The Mahogany Sessions is a pretty dope way of discovering new interesting
music. Some of it is quite soulful:

- [JP Cooper - *Colour Me in Gold*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJkItLf3XqE)
- [Gary Clark Jr. - *Nextdoor Neighbor Blues*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgtcrkI7R58)

It also helped me discover more Allen Stone, which is never a bad thing:

- [Allen Stone - *Contact High*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey_9Y7FbRx0)
- [Allen Stone - *Unaware*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4Hy6kp5kIs)
- [Allen Stone - *Another Break Up Song*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBkmD-5bmCo)

Excellent tunes, definitely worth a listen.
