Clay Shirky is such an inspirational guy. He is one of the only programmers
I have heard of who has achieved such recognition in public speaking. His
TED talks are some of my favourite.

This talk highlights the qualities which allow open source to thrive. My
favourite quote:

> We have always loved one another. We're human, it's something we're good
> at. But, up until recently, the radius and half-life of that affection
> has been quite limited. With love alone, you can get a birthday party
> together. Add coordinating tools, and you can write an operating system.
> In the past, we would do little things for love -- but big things, big
> things required money. Now, we can do big things for love. Thank you.
