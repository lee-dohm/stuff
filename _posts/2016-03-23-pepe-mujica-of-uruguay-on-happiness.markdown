Lucia Newman of Al Jazeera interviewed JosÃ© Mujica while he was still
President of Uruguay on a number of different issues. She closed with the
question: "What do you think is the secret for happiness?" His answer was
beautiful.

This applies to the disaffected of my generation who believe they should be
living a life of riches gallivanting around the world but are stuck working
9-5 jobs just to feel like they'll have enough food to eat. The economic
realities don't line up with what we were told growing up and our
expectations of comfort and security.
