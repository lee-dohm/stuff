What a tremendous time to be alive. The President has announced that he's
recommended that we change our policies on Cuba. My favourite quote from
his speech (which is largely typical rhetoric):

> In particular, I want to thank His Holiness Pope Francis, whose moral
> example shows us the importance of pursuing a world as it *should* be
> rather than simply settling for the world as it is.

I knew I liked the Pope.
