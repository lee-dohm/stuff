[Haley Van Dyck][] helps maintain [Project Open Data][] on GitHub. She wins
Comment of the Day today for her note regarding the re-opening of the U.S.
Federal Government last night. Here are the highlights:

> It continues to be a fascinating journey working at the intersection of
> policy, law, and technology. Every day seems to present new opportunities for
> precedents, new challenges that haven’t been confronted, and new questions
> that have never been asked before. Managing open source projects and a
> government shutdown definitely being one of them.
>
> ...
>
> It’s an honor to work on the challenging issues of integrating new technology
> into longstanding policy and legal paradigms, and in some cases, even being
> able to update those policies in the process.
>
> Very pleased to close this issue, and I appreciate everyone who contributes to
> this project. Thanks all.

The rest of the thread is pretty terrible in some respects, but this comment
restored a lot of my faith that the people behind what the government actually
does are pretty cool and very rational people. It's those darned lawmakers that
are [so crazy!][]
