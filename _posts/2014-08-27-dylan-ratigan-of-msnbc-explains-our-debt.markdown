Oh, wow. Dylan Ratigan is the host of the *Dylan Ratigan Show* on MSNBC. I
have never seen his show before, but I think this is his very best work,
even if it was somewhat unintentional.

He lost his temper on the show when discussing/debating the national debt,
and what he says is brilliantly blunt and direct. You can watch the video
or read the transcript. Note that Ratigan doesn't ever stop yelling
throughout this segment. His passion is admirable.

> RATIGAN: We owe 70 trillion dollars. ... to walk out with a 4 trillion
> dollar solution which is basically just a way for the Democrats to avoid
> dealing with this until 2017. I'm not here to talk about plans to deal
> with this until 2017. I'm saying we got a real problem and I'm tired of
> Republicans and Democrats, Republicans who want to burn the place to the
> ground, and Democrats, with all due respect, who want to offer a plan
> that gets it through the end of their second term of their presidency and
> then screws me and my kids when it's over.
>
> And to do that we have to deal
> with the extraction that is afoot. It is the reason the financial markets
> are behaving the way they're behaving. It is a mathematical fact. This is
> not some opinion, this is a mathematical fact. Tens of trillions of
> dollars are being extracted from the United States of America. Democrats
> aren't doing it, Republicans are not doing it. An entire integrated
> system -- financial system, trading system, taxing system -- that was
> created by both parties over a period of two decades is at work on our
> entire country right now. And we're sitting here arguing whether we
> should do the 4 trillion dollar plan that kicks the can down the road for
> the president in 2017, or to burn the place to the ground, both of which
> are reckless, irresponsible, and stupid.
>
> And the fact of the matter is
> until we actually -- and I'm sorry to lose my temper and get -- but I
> tell you what. I've been coming on TV for 3 years doing this and the fact
> of the matter is that there is a refusal on both the democratic and the
> republican side of the aisle to acknowledge the mathematical problem,
> which is that the United States of America is being extracted. It's being
> extracted through banking, it's being extracted through trade, and it's
> being extracted through taxation, and there's not a single politician
> that has stepped forward, Susan, to deal with this.
>
> ...
>
> RATIGAN: It is about one guy [the President].
>
> PURPLE DRESS: What would you like him to do? Tell me what you want him to
> do.
>
>
> RATIGAN: I would like him to go to the people of the United States of
> America and say, "People of the United States of America, your Congress
> is bought. Your Congress is incapable of making legislation on
> healthcare, banking, trade, or taxes, because if they do it, they will
> lose their political funding and they won't do it. But I'm the President
> of the United States, and I won't have a country that's run by a bought
> Congress. So I'm not going to work with the bought Congress, and try to
> be Mr. Big-Guy-I'm-Working-With-The-Bought-Congress, I'm going to abandon
> the bought Congress like Teddy Roosevelt did, and I'm going to go to the
> people of the United States and I'm going to say, 'You have a bought
> Congress, and until we get rid of the bought Congress'", -- which is Jimmy
> Williams' constant point, to get the money out of politics -- and until
> a President that says that's the problem and says he's going to
> fix it, there is no policy I can possibly see [...] as long as there's
> the capacity to basically fire a politician who disagrees with me by
> taking funding away from them. Is that a fair assessment?
>
> WILLIAMS: Money in politics is the root of all political evil. It is
> corruption at its worst. And until we step up and kick that out of the
> park, it's going to be the same system all the way.
>
> RATIGAN: And only the President can do that.
>
> WILLIAM: No, no, no, the Congress has to do it too.
>
> RATIGAN: I'll tell you what, how bad does it have to get, how much money
> has to be extracted, how many things have to be hurt [before this is
> accomplished].
>
> PURPLE DRESS: Ok, physically, what do you do?
>
> RATIGAN: You go and give a speech.
>
> PURPLE DRESS: Right now?
>
> RATIGAN: Yes, right now.
>
> PURPLE DRESS: Then what happens tomorrow?
>
> RATIGAN: Tomorrow, what happens, is you begin the process of actually
> investing in solving the problem. So if I come out and I say --
>
> PURPLE DRESS: How?
>
> RATIGAN: How?? I create an infrastructure bank with 2 percent lending,
> immediately. Once I explain to people the problem -- once I explain to
> you that you have cancer -- once you understand how screwed up your
> trade, tax, and banking policies are, believe me: you will have no issue
> when I incorporate an infrastructure bank that I fund with repatriated
> offshore money that I bring in and then use to create 2 percent direct
> lending to every business in America, because when you realize the
> banking system is fully corrupt and defrauding us, and I come out and say
> that, which is what I want my President to do, then at that exact moment
> I say, "You know what? We got a screwed up situation here, people. You
> all know it and you know what, I'm going to admit it." And as a result
> not only have I admitted it, but we're going to begin the process of
> solving it like grownups. They did it in World War II, they did it after
> the Civil War, they did it with Latin America with the Brady Bonds. We
> are not seeing it happen now.

The intensity of his deliver is well worth spending the 4:45 to watch the
video.
