JosÃ© Mujica, the President of Uruguay from 2010-2015, gave an interview for
[Human the Movie](https://humanthemovie.withgoogle.com/) where he talks
about his experience coming to live the way he lives. My favourite part is
linked above:

> I spent almost ten years in solitary, in a hole. Plenty of time to
> think... I spent seven years without one book! That left me time to
> think.
>
> And this is what I discovered: Either you're happy with very little --
> free of all that extra luggage because you have happiness inside -- or
> you don't get anywhere. I am not advocating poverty, I am advocating
> sobriety.
>
> But since we have invented a consumer society, the economy must
> constantly grow. If it fails to increase, it's a tragedy. We invented a
> mountain of superfluous needs. Shopping for the new, discarding the
> old... that's a waste of our lives.
>
> When I buy something -- when you buy something, you're not paying money for
> it. You're paying with the hours of life you had to spend earning that
> money. The difference is that life is one thing money can't buy. Life
> only gets shorter. And it is pitiful to waste one's life a freedom that
> way.
>
> ...
>
> I'm not suggesting we go back to living in caves or straw huts. Not at
> all. No, no, that's not the idea. What I do recommend is that wstop
> wasting resources on useless things, on luxurious houses that require
> six servants to maintain. What good is that? None of that is necessary.
> We can live much more modestly. We can spend our resource on things that
> are really important for everyone. That's the real meaning of democracy.

I will definitely be looking to hear more of what he has to say.
