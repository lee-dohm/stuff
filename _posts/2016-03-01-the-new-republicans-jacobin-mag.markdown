[Jacobin Mag](https://www.jacobinmag.com/) contributor Doug Henwood writes
convincingly of the move of the Democratic Party Establisment away from the
Left, away from liberalism. Historically, disaffected workers have voted
for the Democratic Party candidate. At the beginning of the twentieth
century, it was the Democrats who supported trust-busting and unions which
led to better labor conditions. For many year&mdash;perhaps since
Reagan&mdash; there has been a retreat of the party establishment to the
political right. They have abandoned the poor and disaffected who used to
once make up their strongest cohort. Many of the poor and disaffected,
mostly the poor white, have cut their losses and have moved to support the
Republican Party with its talk of small government and fewer taxes. As the
Democratic Party loses its core base, it is trying to win more of upper
middle class suburbia. They don't need a lot of the liberal values that
made up the Democratic Party then to appeal to that base, so they're
eschewing them.

Read Mr. Henwood's take on this shift and how it plays into the current
election cycle.

defined and defended.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqrG9N-cmds)
