Camille Fournier speaks brilliantly about the difficulties in distributed
systems design.

At 29:00, Camille talks about the Monolith vs. Microservices discussion.
One key trade-off, she notes, is that with Microservices, you're sharding
your human resources, so if you lose an employee on a 2-person
microservice, it costs a lot more to train someone on that stack. With a
monolith, every engineer is proficient in the development tools, the
testing stack, the language, and the datastore(s) used, so they're fairly
interchangeable with each other. If one leaves, it's not too hard for the
other employees to pick up the slack. I thought this was a very interesting
trade-off which isn't well-discussed.
