Kim Burrell is one of my favourite vocalists. She is unparalleled. Her runs
are out of this world, and her voice is so real. She's has a unique ability
to touch the hearts of her listeners. During this video interview, in true
Kim fashion, she begins to sing one of my favourites, "Be Grateful."

Bonus: ["How Great is Our God"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGDjo8V2Swo)
with Fred Hammond, Kim Burrell, Donnie McClurkin, Kirk Franklin, Jonathan
Nelson, and Andrea Mellini, some of gospel's greats.
