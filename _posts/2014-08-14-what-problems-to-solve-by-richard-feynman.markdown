Richard Feynman was one of the most brilliant men to have ever been born.
He speaks with great eloquence and humour about quantum mechanics and
mathematics. He has recently fascinated me.

This letter somehow found its way into my browser window and, upon reading
it, I was impressed by this:

> No problem is too small or too trivial if we can really do something
> about it.
>
> You say you are a nameless man. You are not to your wife and to your
> child. You will not long remain so to your immediate colleagues if you
> can answer their simple questions when they come into your office. You
> are not nameless to me. Do not remain nameless to yourself – it is too
> sad a way to be. now your place in the world and evaluate yourself
> fairly, not in terms of your naïve ideals of your own youth, nor in terms
> of what you erroneously imagine your teacher’s ideals are.

An excellent letter. It also shows the kindness with which Feynman
approached each and every pupil.
