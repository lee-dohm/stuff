I am admittedly not quite sure how I feel about open access to all human
knowledge. My gut tells me all people ought to have access to the treasure
trove of collected human understanding. It can further causes like a cure
for cancer, or help some underdog invent the next Big Thing. I, for one,
would love to be able to access Jstor for many years to come even though I
have graduated. Access to that knowledge is crucial for learning from the
learned.

At any rate, this is [Aaron Swartz][internets-own-boy]'s take on open
access to scholarly work, entitled the "Guerilla Open Access Manifesto."
