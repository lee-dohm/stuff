It has taken me several weeks to watch this entire video and for good
reason: it's a bit silly in places. The narrator sounds like a 14-year-old
guy and it triggers the evil monkey voices in my brain that say, "This guy
doesn't have authority on this subject."

Well, much of what I have learned overlaps. And it includes several
wonderful interviews with the luminaries in the Linux world early on.

One quote from Richard Stallman totally stopped me in my tracks. It starts
around 33:40 in the video.

That is a very interesting critique of the open source movement, and one
that explains my simultaneous excitement and reluctance regarding the "free
software" movement.
