Ed Sheeran is a pretty dope guy. He records a mean album, too. But in
comparison to his performances in "The Live Room," his album is mediocre.
It hardly does justice to his incredible talent for improvisation -- just
taking a musical idea and riffing on it. I'm left floored after each song:

- ["Give Me Love"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j8cADX87-2I)
- ["You Need Me, I Don't Need You"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DV0TJZ7Kp40)
- ["Lego House"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYTQ2ZSkGfg)
- ["The A Team"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOwsttzkUgs&list=PLAA1D1295E15E6E6C#t=28)

And another, but for a different outlet:

- ["Kiss Me"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhHyZFiE5fQ)
