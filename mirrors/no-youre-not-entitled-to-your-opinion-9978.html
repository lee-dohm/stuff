            <p>Every year, I try to do at least two things with my students at least once. First, I make a point of addressing them as “philosophers” – a bit cheesy, but hopefully it <a href="http://secure.pdcnet.org/teachphil/content/teachphil_2012_0035_0002_0143_0169">encourages active learning</a>.</p>

<p>Secondly, I say something like this: “I’m sure you’ve heard the expression ‘everyone is entitled to their opinion.’ Perhaps you’ve even said it yourself, maybe to head off an argument or bring one to a close. Well, as soon as you walk into this room, it’s no longer true. You are not entitled to your opinion. You are only entitled to what you can argue for.”</p>

<p>A bit harsh? Perhaps, but philosophy teachers owe it to our students to teach them how to construct and defend an argument – and to recognize when a belief has become indefensible.</p>

<p>The problem with “I’m entitled to my opinion” is that, all too often, it’s used to shelter beliefs that should have been abandoned. It becomes shorthand for “I can say or think whatever I like” – and by extension, continuing to argue is somehow disrespectful.  And this attitude feeds, I suggest, into the false equivalence between experts and non-experts that is an increasingly pernicious feature of our public discourse.</p>

<p>Firstly, what’s an opinion?</p>

<p>Plato distinguished between opinion or common belief (doxa) and certain knowledge, and that’s still a workable distinction today: unlike “1+1=2” or “there are no square circles,” an opinion has a degree of subjectivity and uncertainty to it. But “opinion” ranges from tastes or preferences, through views about questions that concern most people such as prudence or politics, to views grounded in technical expertise, such as legal or scientific opinions.</p>

<p>You can’t really argue about the first kind of opinion. I’d be silly to insist that you’re wrong to think strawberry ice cream is better than chocolate. The problem is that sometimes we implicitly seem to take opinions of the second and even the third sort to be unarguable in the way questions of taste are. Perhaps that’s one reason (no doubt there are others) why enthusiastic amateurs think they’re entitled to disagree with climate scientists and immunologists and have their views “respected.”</p>

<p>Meryl Dorey is the leader of the Australian Vaccination Network, which despite the name is vehemently anti-vaccine. Ms. Dorey has no medical qualifications, but <a href="http://www.essentialbaby.com.au/baby/baby-health/adverse-reactions-why-some-parents-fear-vaccines-20120507-1y7w7.html">argues</a> that if Bob Brown is allowed to comment on nuclear power despite not being a scientist, she should be allowed to comment on vaccines. But no-one assumes Dr. Brown is an authority on the physics of nuclear fission; his job is to comment on the policy responses to the science, not the science itself.</p>

<p>So what does it mean to be “entitled” to an opinion?</p>

<p>If “Everyone’s entitled to their opinion” just means no-one has the right to stop people thinking and saying whatever they want, then the statement is true, but fairly trivial. No one can stop you saying that vaccines cause autism, no matter how many times that claim has been disproven.</p>

<p>But if ‘entitled to an opinion’ means ‘entitled to have your views treated as serious candidates for the truth’ then it’s pretty clearly false. And this too is a distinction that tends to get blurred.</p>

<p>On Monday, the ABC’s Mediawatch program took WIN-TV Wollongong to task for running a story on a measles outbreak which included comment from – you guessed it – Meryl Dorey. In a response to a viewer complaint, WIN said that the story was “<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/1235_win.pdf">accurate, fair and balanced and presented the views of the medical practitioners and of the choice groups</a>.” But this implies an equal right to be heard on a matter in which only one of the two parties has the relevant expertise. Again, if this was about policy responses to science, this would be reasonable. But the so-called “debate” here is about the science itself, and the “choice groups” simply don’t have a claim on air time if that’s where the disagreement is supposed to lie.</p>

<p>Mediawatch host Jonathan Holmes was considerably more blunt: “<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/s3601416.htm">there’s evidence, and there’s bulldust</a>,” and it’s no part of a reporter’s job to give bulldust equal time with serious expertise.</p>

<p>The response from anti-vaccination voices was predictable. On the Mediawatch site, Ms. Dorey accused the ABC of “openly calling for censorship of a scientific debate.” This response confuses not having your views taken seriously with not being allowed to hold or express those views at all – or to borrow a phrase from Andrew Brown, it “<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/andrewbrown/2012/aug/03/tainted-case-against-gay-marriage">confuses losing an argument with losing the right to argue</a>.” Again, two senses of “entitlement” to an opinion are being conflated here.</p>

<p>So next time you hear someone declare they’re entitled to their opinion, ask them why they think that. Chances are, if nothing else, you’ll end up having a more enjoyable conversation that way.</p>

      <p>If everyone followed Patrick Stokes&#39; suggestion, we would still believe stress caused stomach ulcers, that miasma spread disease, that the universe is Ptolemeic and a host of other conventional, mainstream, orthodox science.</p>

<p>Very often valid dissenting views come from quite separate disciplines from those holding the orthodox position.</p>

<p>I know where Patrick is coming from, and I don&#39;t want to see homeopathy, crystal healing and astrology given equal time in discussion of disease treatment and Medicare funding. However, not all &quot;bulldust&quot; retains that status as science advances and paradigms are overturned.</p>

      <p>The article suggests not everyone has &#39;an equal right to be heard&#39;. It&#39;s not really clear what that means in practical terms.</p>

<p>Most agree the anti-vaccination case is spurious. That&#39;s really a red herring. The issue is how we - laypeople, the media, academia, government - respond to dodgy ideas.</p>

<p>Going by the last paragraph, I think Patrick is simply saying we should challenge bad arguments. However the name of the article (chosen by an editor?) suggests people should be prevented from expressing illogical thoughts. It&#39;s a little unclear.</p>

      <p>Keith, you put forward an interesting if flawed conclusion. I do not think that Patrick would dismiss the new evidence from diverse fields but it is ENTIRELY valid to utterly dismiss erroneous and simply wrong information that has a life of its own such as the oft repeated mantra that vacinations are linked with autism.  This has repeatedly been proven wrong -utterly falsified data has been proven to be used and the scientist admitted that there is NO link whatsoever. This belief is continuing to harm society and nonvacinated children and even other adults. Once out on the internet, thi bogus information continues as though it is credible and there appears to be no mechanism for truly and finally debunking it and removing it from circulation. </p>

<p>The point is, in my opinion, that we are all free to bring forth information but once it is proven to be invalid it is no longer an opinion but rather a misconception. Once your perspective is proven false it is time to stop saying it. When you are just plain right -as your fellow Aussie was about ulcers, the world should listen-  If they can not definatively refute the conclusion. When in doubt we should still listen but there comes a time when in the public space, the noise should be dismissed and people should have the grace to admit when they are wrong. The consequences of continuing with such lies kill people and here in Canada we had an epidemic of chicken pox that started at an eastern university and spread across our countryduring spring break a few years ago because people relied on this sort of not only unvalidated but disproved garbage. Vacinations are important for everyone&#39;s health and people think that they are making a personal choice when they do not vacinate their child BUT it turns out that it puts us all at risk because even when people are properly vacinated it is not 100% effective for everyone and thus they should be protected overall by general compliance and reliance on truth. </p>

      <p>&quot;If everyone followed Patrick Stokes&#39; suggestion, we would still believe X Y and Z.&quot;</p>

<p>This is not the case at all, Keith. Indeed, it is the exact opposite.</p>

<p>Patrick&#39;s position - You are not entitled to your opinion. You are only entitled to what you can argue for -  is the reason why we no longer believe in Miasmas, helicentrism, and stress induced ulcers.</p>

<p>In Patrick&#39;s words again, people have been able &quot;to recognize when a belief has become indefensible.&quot;</p>

<p>It is not that dissenting opinions are rejected out of hand, but that all opinions must be weighed using the tools we have to hand - the inductive, deductive and adductive capacities. Scientific methdology and valid inference. </p>

      <p>Geoffrey Edwards, you say that, &quot;all opinions must be weighed using the tools we have to hand - the inductive, deductive and adductive capacities. Scientific methdology and valid inference.&quot; </p>

<p>But who is to determine the validity of the scientific methodology used? What you seem to be inferring is that only those who are &#39;scientifically qualified&#39; are able to determine the truth of an argument and therefore, these same &#39;scientists&#39; should be able to block what those less well-informed can and cannot know and say.</p>

<p>That makes these self-appointed arbiters no better then the priests in the middle ages who preached in Latin so the common folk wouldn&#39;t understand what they were saying and would just have to take it as read that the clergy were telling the truth as though spoken by God. </p>

<p>I say that dissenting opinions, information and evidence on the subject of vaccination ARE rejected out of hand. There is a true tyranny at play when it comes to this issue - it is the tyranny of what we know to be true. And because it is so well-founded, so set in stone, any and all dissenters are automatically named to be anti-vaccine and discounted. It doesn&#39;t matter how many scientific experts there are on our side or how much proof we have of a particular vaccine&#39;s ineffectiveness or risks - all that matters is that we are questioning a subject which people like Patrick Stokes have said is above question. </p>

<p>Well, let me state right here - nothing in science is above question. Science is all about questioning - over and over and over again - because science is not infallible and a look at every edition of any peer-reviewed journal will provide ample proof of that fact.</p>

<p>So don&#39;t stifle the debate - welcome it. And if what the AVN is saying is so invalid, it will be proven to be so by the court of public opinion since people have the right to weigh up these issues for themselves and are very capable of doing so without the intervention of the scientific &#39;elite&#39;.</p>

      <p>Meryl you said &quot;That makes these self-appointed arbiters&quot; when referring to scientists. It is their qualifications, knowledge and expertise that give them the authority to be the arbiters. You have none of these, so who exactly is self appointed?</p>

<p>You are correct in saying that nothing in science is above question but not by laypeople like you who don&#39;t understand the science.  You see it is science and not an &quot;issue&quot;. So the only people who can question it with credibility are scientists.</p>

<p>The court of public opinion IS proving that what you say is invalid in the numerous media pieces that expose your fraudulent claims.</p>

<p>No. I am not &quot;implying&quot; that at all. This a strawman.</p>

<p>The rest is just post-modernism for the lay-man</p>

<p>Science is confirmed or falsified by more science - not public opinion.</p>

<p>If you have no wish to respect those who have spent many years honing their skills and regularly subjected to the harshest criticism by their peers, then their seems little reason of having a balanced discussion on the merits of science.</p>

<p>Science Works. The evidence is there for everyone to see. You are typing on it. </p>

      <p>I might suggest, Meryl, to make this a level playing field; and to remove all suggestion that that science is a form of priveleged obscurism, that you enrol for a Bachelors in Medical Science.  Your dissenting opinion may be regarded with more gravity should it be backed with evidence.</p>

      <p>Meryl dear, you DO realise that your argument (and I use the term both charitably and in its loosest possible sense) &quot;And if what the AVN is saying is so invalid, it will be proven to be so by the court of public opinion since people have the right to weigh up these issues for themselves and are very capable of doing so without the intervention of the scientific &#39;elite&#39;&quot; could apply to all sorts of things. </p>

<p>For example, replace &#39;scientific&#39; with &#39;political&#39; and it could apply to the reintroduction of hanging. </p>

<p>Dangerous thing, the court of public opinion. Or do you suggest that it&#39;s wise that the opinion of people who don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about should be privileged over that of those who do?</p>

<p>When your toilet backs up, do you call a plumber, or consult the court of public opinion?</p>

      <p>I think to take the article to its conclusion those in the media who are responsible for framing debates should have sufficient critical faculties to realise the relative expertise and worth of those on opposing ends of the debate.  Media Watch&#39;s point is that it is irresponsible for the media to represent a fringe element has having an equally valid argument as the vast body of science.  That filter should already be applied by a reporter versed in medical science (which is why some media have science reporters).  
<br />This is the responsibility of the media, I would think, as the vast proportion of the audience are not versed in discriminating between science, pseudo-science, flat-earthers and  con-jobs.  I include you, me and probably all contributors to this site; as cognitive biases are the norm not the exception and it&#39;s a rare person indeed who can think critically all of the time.</p>

      <p>I would love to hear your alternative avenues to truth, Meryl. You are the first to point to (flawed, discredited or irrelevant) scientific papers when trying to make your own point; why bother, if you&#39;ve got some killer truth-seeking method in your back pocket you haven&#39;t told us about, e.g. revelation, the Power of Anecdote, wishful thinking, The Secret etc? It seems you only wish to appropriate the cloak of science when you (wrongly) assume it supports your biases; in other cases, as here, you&#39;d rather hit the big red Epistemic Relativism button, in the hope that even though it helps you not a whit, at least it may cause damage to others.</p>

<p>Now, here&#39;s my lengthy dissertation on the relative abilities of science and the priesthood in approaching truth, bear with me, it gets a little nuanced: Science works.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing in science is above question&quot; is correct. However, you keep asking the same questions with mind-numbing frequency, and they&#39;ve been shown umpteen times to have no value. You won&#39;t have any chance of getting a different answer unless you start asking some different questions, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be your thing.</p>

<p>The scientific experts aren&#39;t on your side. You have no proof to support your claims. Your claims are now rejected out of hand because they&#39;re the _same claims_ that were properly investigated and shown to have no substance. It thus saves everyone a lot of time to ignore them more quickly as they keep bobbing back up like objects whose description I will leave to Mungo MacCallum. </p>

<p>Anyone can be a scientist, in the sense of using the scientific method. It&#39;s not a cabal of sinister &quot;elites&quot; that are out to program us to watch X Factor via jabs full of mind-control toxins. You could even do science yourself, if you were so inclined.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t believe you are questioning the validity of the scientific method on one hand, while supporting the &quot;court of public opinion&quot; with the other. This stance pretty much says it all. What is your plan for making the rest of us take you seriously?</p>

      <p>Ms Dorey, there&#39;s a lot of eloquent, well-expressed content to your comment, for which I thank you, and I&#39;m glad you introduce the word &quot;evidence&quot;.  To date, no evidence has supported the claims of the Australian Vaccination Network.  </p>

<p>Meanwhile, neonates contract and die of infections from unvaccinated older children.</p>

<p>Do you think there could be a lesson in ethics here? </p>

      <p>Dear David (I hope you don&#39;t mind if I call you David?). </p>

<p>You have made a broad statement - &quot;To date, no evidence has supported the claims of the Australian Vaccination Network.&quot; Would you mind being more specific. Can you please cite one claim that either our organisation or myself personally have made which you believe is not backed by scientific evidence? That will give me an opportunity to provide you with my evidence which, you can either agree or disagree with, but at least it will show you that there is evidence for the things we state. We&#39;re pretty careful about that though we have made mistakes in the past and admitted them when we&#39;ve been shown that something we&#39;ve said was wrong.</p>

<p>Oh, and thank you for your kind words about my comments. For 15 years, until the formation of the organisation Stop the AVN - a group which uses hatred, intimidation, personal threats and cyberbullying to argue their viewpoint (all in the name of science), we had always conducted ourselves in a respectful manner when it came to those who were not vaccine critical. I have always felt that a scientific debate should be carried out in that way and appreciate the fact that you agree.</p>

      <p>Meryl, the thing is - you have no education in any of the sciences in order to be able to make a qualified opinion on anything. </p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier, you rely on pseudoscience and misinterpretations of actual science to bolster your insane case. </p>

      <p>Actually, Ms Dorey, I think the onus is on the AVN to show which of its claims is irrefutably backed by evidence that has passed peer review in the respectable medical research journals.  
<br />And as for your &quot;court of public opinion&quot;, it has voted and the AVN represents at best a tiny, tiny minority.  So therefore, on your own criterion, you should shut up shop and go away.</p>

      <p>And Joe, if I graduated with my Bacherlors Degree in Medical Science and still held to my views on vaccination, you would simply say that my qualifications were not good enough and I would need a PhD. There are thousands and thousands of doctors, specialists and research scientists who agree with me on vaccination. But science is not a beauty contest nor is it a test of numbers (except for the numbers used to determine results in studies). Science is about the evidence and I have a great deal of evidence to back up my concerns about vaccine safety and effectiveness. We are not talking about opinions here - we are talking about evidence. And you are saying that somehow, evidence changes based on the qualifications of the individual discussing it. Think about it for a while, Joe. I think you will agree that is a ridiculous assertion.</p>

      <p>Meryl - the AVN frequently maintains that autism is somehow caused by vaccines. There is not one shred of good scientific proof to back up this assertion, and literally hundreds of studies proving this is not the case.
<br />Therefore this is one claim that you make which is not backed up by scientific eveidence.
<br />There are many more.

      <p>There are not &quot;thousands and thousands&quot; of trained medical professionals that agree with you at all. If I am wrong, then please compile a list, include their profession and qualifications, and put it on your website. I think you&#39;ll find there  are very few in comparison to the majority that definitely disagree with you. If there are thousands, then there are hundreds of thousands that disagree.</p>

<p>How about &quot;…the child that died a couple of years ago, in New South Wales, was the first death from Whooping Cough, in over a decade, um, in Australia…&quot;, made even after being corrected months before.</p>

      <p>Scott,</p>

<p>You don&#39;t know me. You have no idea of what my education is and to be honest with you, this is irrelevant. </p>

<p>Stop making personal comments about me and deal with the issue. I asked you to show me something that I have said which you can prove is scientifically not correct. If you can&#39;t do so, then stop making aspersions about any qualifications I may or may not have. You don&#39;t need a science degree to understand science any more than possession of a degree will guarantee your understanding.</p>

<p>No, but it most certainly helps. Without the relevant training and education you have no way of interpreting the data, no way of understanding the nuances that are involved in any given study. Without the relevant education, and clearly without understanding a single thing about how science actually works (remember, facts are not determined by debate, and ultimately - opinion).</p>

<p>Would you set about wiring an entire house without first gaining the correct education and experience? I don&#39;t think you would. </p>

<p>All you have is opinion, and a dangerous one at that.</p>

<br />Now, you could read my report and make all kinds of statements based on it. But without being part of the conversation (ie in the field) you really cant make quality judgements on the data.</p>

<p>I know where the issues lie in the data we get, because states do things differently. I know to what degree I can make judgements about Victoria&#39;s mortality rate from say, falls and know whether that is something I&#39;d be supremely confident in making life or death decisions about, compared to NSW. </p>

<p>Everyone else in this field knows the SAME THINGS about data issues. It&#39;s these nuances that you are ignorant of (reports generally have a data issues section) that mean the difference between a lay person&#39;s interpretation and a policy maker who would ASK for the expert to interpret their report.
<br />YOU don&#39;t ask the experts opinion and even when you get it, you completely ignore it.</p>

<p>That is why you generally need the degrees to understand the science. So you understand how to look for the WHOLE picture, not just the bits you want to.

The thing is, you want us to stop making personal comments about you and deal with the issue, but you are the issue, Meryl. You&#39;re the one spreading junk science and demonstrating why we require credentials of our medical professionals in the first place. Sure, you don&#39;t need a degree to understand science, but think of it as a driver&#39;s license - we don&#39;t let unlicensed drivers drive cars because they haven&#39;t demonstrated they have the ability to do so according to the law. The same applies to medical qualifications - and you don&#39;t have any, so regardless of your education, without those credentials, how can you expect anyone to take you seriously, and why should we? You&#39;re like an unlicensed driver possibly threatening the lives of motorists and pedestrians alike. </p>

<p>But you&#39;re worse than that - you&#39;re sitting there telling doctors they&#39;re all wrong. You can take that trash and shove it - it&#39;s like an unlicensed driver telling a licenced driver how to drive. Until you have some kind of medical credentials demonstrating that you&#39;ve put in the work to establish yourself in the field, then you aren&#39;t even worth having a conversation with about medical matters. You want us to stop talking about you? Then stop giving us something to talk about.</p>

      <p>Hi Meryl,</p>

<p>As I asked above, why have you decided against undertaking any formal studies in science over the past twenty years that you have spent researching vaccine safety and efficacy? </p>

<p>If I wanted to devote myself to campaigning for something I felt strongly about, I would do what I could to obtain the best education on the topic as possible. In your case, attending university could give you insights into how researchers operate, a solid background in biomedical science and an opportunity to be involved in discourse with professionals in the field.</p>

      <p>&quot;But who is to determine the validity of the scientific methodology used?&quot;</p>

<p>Well anyone can, provided they understand the principles of fair testing, the differences between correlation and causation, the factors that comprise a valid design of a scientific investigation, what sample size is reasonable to make more general conclusions from, statistical analysis and the significance of various parameters that accompany any trends in the data such as r values, how to account for variables that cannot be controlled e.g. in human studies where experimenters cannot manipulate every aspect of an individual&#39;s life to conform to methodological protocols, how to account for underlying genetic diversity in the population being studied, the limits of extrapolation of data from studies on various subpopulations of the world (e.g. do data from Japanese populations apply to sub-Saharan Africans?)...and so on. </p>

<p>I know enough to know that I don&#39;t know enough to be able to do a good job of this in most instances. I look particularly at graphs and regressions and squiggles and numbers and go blluuuuergh. </p>

<p>However, I can identify obvious flaws in methodology. For example: 
<br />a) A study of only 12 subjects is nowhere near enough to make any conclusions from. At most, it might only be enough to start to collect together a hazy concept of a potential future investigation. 
<br />b) Data obtained from a study of the effect of something on people who already have a specific medical condition cannot reasonably be applied to a population of people who don&#39;t have that specific medical condition.</p>

<p>For those reasons alone, I can determine that Andrew Wakefield&#39;s infamous MMR study has pretty much no value in terms of its applicability. If it showed anything, it was merely that something *might* be worth investigating further with some proper and rigorous science. Unfortunately, too many people took his conclusion, misstated it, then attempted to apply it universally, which (as is obvious) was totally misguided. </p>

<p>And yet, his hypothesis was indeed studied further, with much larger sample sizes (e.g. tens of thousands, as compared to his 12) and even though the link he proposed was specifically looked for in the data, it has not been found. Multiple studies on different populations with a much wider range of genetic diversity and uncontrollable other lifestyle factors have pretty much all confirmed there was nothing to this hypothesis.</p>

<p>That is an example of how anyone, even a comparatively uneducated B.Sc (Hons) like me, with 7 years of Science education, almost 9 years of teaching Science, and an additional 4 years of reading Science now behind me, can evaluate a scientific method.

<p>&quot;But who is to determine the validity of the scientific methodology used? &quot;</p>

<p>Thousands of years of international efforts by millions of philosophers, mathematicians, engineers, and general scientists who have debated, devised, challenged, overturned and where necessary, reinstated, a plethora of options to define, measure, assess and understand evidence.</p>

<p>The door will always be open to question the methods and develop more accurate kinds. The day that stops, science is dead.</p>

      <p>May I also add concerning:</p>

<p>&quot;That makes these self-appointed arbiters no better then the priests in the middle ages who preached in Latin so the common folk wouldn&#39;t understand what they were saying and would just have to take it as read that the clergy were telling the truth as though spoken by God. &quot;</p>

<p>The over-reliance on jargon can give that impression, however, at the same time jargon has developed in response to requiring clear language for increasingly subtle and specific concepts.</p>

<p>Also, unlike the middle ages, we have attempts at universal education, with higher rates of literacy.  We also have the internet, and when it&#39;s not being used to selectively quote or misquote particular ideas (by all concerned, I&#39;m not just talking about vaccination issues here) it&#39;s also being used by these &quot;arbiters&quot; to &quot;translate&quot; the jargon into something a bit more tangible.</p>

<p>There are billions of websites on the internet. Once you get past social networking, porn and propaganda, you find librarians, philosophers, scientists.  The Gutenberg Project,  The Conversation, and entire &quot;Evil&quot; torrents dedicated to making the classical Greek works that underpin so many things in western culture available.  There are free courses in maths, science, history; and people to learn and debate from.</p>

<p>This is by no stretch of the imagination the same as the middle ages. Particularly the bit where the infant mortality rate has dropped massively, as a result of two things: sanitation and vaccination.</p>

      <p>Not at all, his argument is;
<br />If you have an opinion that differs from the currently accepted reason, supply the relevant evidence and explain to me why the evidence you supply over-rides the evidence that exists to support the currently accepted reason.
<br />And that&#39;s exactly what happened in the case of all you examples!</p>

      <p>Meryl,</p>

<p>What I find most concerning is not that you have absolutely no idea what you&#39;re talking about, but you&#39;re actually a detriment to humanity.  To every parent who falls for your disinformation, you risk their child becoming seriously ill, or even dying.</p>

<p>I hope your misguided grief for your son is only amplified by knowing how many other parents will suffer similar fates, because of your lies.</p>

      <p>&quot;Are you entitled to your opinion?&quot; is of course a trick question. The trick being the world of difference between having an opinion and to what degree you are entitled to &#39;express&#39; that opinion. The answer to the real question &quot;To what degree are you entitled to express your opinion?&quot; in capitalist society, as far as your dollar can spread it, fact.</p>

      <p>the idea about autism came about when some mothers on an autim site found their kids got it after their multi immunisations. this could have happened due to coincidence, but i can understand their reluctance to risk their childs health. when scientists then proclaimed that as being a stupid load of rubbish,cos after all what would some dim housewives know,then they weren&#39;t inclined to fall into their arms , crying yes! we were only dumb mothers !how could we doubt you! we should have realised you are always right, and so much smarter than us!

      <p>I refer to neonates dying of diseases to which they&#39;re exposed before they&#39;re old enough to be immunised, and Lee Hatfield requests Australian statistics.</p>

<p>Well, I don&#39;t have statistics, but I have heard personal accounts from nursing staff.</p>

<p>Anyway, every time a new born dies, there&#39;s a waste of taxpayer funds in obstretic and maternal support.  So to minimise that waste, minimising the population disease load through immunisation makes dollars and cents sense.</p>

      <p>Ms Dorey, </p>

<p>I suggest that you and your organisation agitate for public schools in major urban areas that accept enrolments only from children who have not been vaccinated.</p>

<p>This will demonstrate, once and for all, any and all superiority of outcomes for non-vaccinated children.</p>

      <p>Mr Arthur,</p>

<p>I would suggest that instead of asking for a ghetto to be formed for the unvaccinated, you agitate with the federal government to do a scientific study comparing the overall health of the fully vaccinated vs the fully unvaccinated. A study we have been asking for since 2003 and one which would be easy to do considering the fact that we have the ACIR which is linked with our medicare database.</p>

<p>This will demonstrate, once and for all, any and all superiority of outcomes for vaccinated children.</p>

      <p>David Arthur, you have no statistics but have &#39;heard personal accounts&#39;. Hmmmm. Sounds like anecdotal information to me and since those statistics do exist (the number of neonates who die in Australia from infectious diseases), I would suggest you find them before arguing further. This IS science, after all.</p>

<p>Also, since no vaccination can prevent a person - even a fully vaccinated person - from carrying and transmitted pathogenic viruses and bacteria, where is your evidence that neonates are less likely to die if everyone around them was vaccinated? Just wondering since you are making assertions but not providing any evidence. That&#39;s an opinion - and Patrick Stokes says you&#39;re not entitled to it.</p>

      <p>Meryl,</p>

<p>Do you mean something like this study? </p>

<p><a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa021134" rel="nofollow">http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa021134</a>
<br />“There was no increase in the risk of autistic disorder or other autistic-spectrum disorders among vaccinated children as compared with unvaccinated children (adjusted relative risk of autistic disorder, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.68 to 1.24; adjusted relative risk of other autistic-spectrum disorders, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.65 to 1.07).”</p>

<p>Maybe you hadn&#39;t seen it, since it was published in 2002.</p>

<p>Regards,</p>

<p>John &quot;bad cop&quot; Cunningham</p>

      <p>Far from ghetto, Ms Dorey, such a self-selecting experiment is exactly what&#39;s required for unambiguous results.</p>

<p>My understanding is that your organisation is prominent among those which raise concerns about precisely the sort of trials you propose as alternative to my idea.</p>

      <p>Err, I&#39;m not so time-rich as to be botherd, Ms Dorey.  Instead, how about your organisation finds those statistics, and publicises them?  </p>

<p>After all, such evidence would go a long way to advancing your cause - so I&#39;ll assume that should there be no such publication of neonate infection rates, that my assertion is not refuted by statistics.</p>

<p><a href="http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/ijlink?linkType=ABST&amp;journalCode=pediatrics&amp;resid=112/5/1039" rel="nofollow">http://cid.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/ijlink?linkType=ABST&amp;journalCode=pediatrics&amp;resid=112/5/1039</a></p>

<p>&quot;In the United States, using the Vaccine Safety Data Link, researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention examined 140,887 US children born during 1991–1999, including &gt;200 children with autism. The researchers found no relationship between receipt of thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism.&quot;</p>

<p>No link between autism and thimerosal.</p>

      <p>And then of course there&#39;s the German study
<br /><a href="http://www.aerzteblatt.de/int/archive/article?id=80869" rel="nofollow">http://www.aerzteblatt.de/int/archive/article?id=80869</a>
<br />&quot;Evaluable data on vaccinations were available for 13 453 subjects aged 1–17 years from non-immigrant families. 0.7% of them... were not vaccinated. The lifetime prevalence of diseases preventable by vaccination was markedly higher in unvaccinated than in vaccinated subjects. Unvaccinated children aged 1–5 years had a median number of 3.3 (2.1–4.6) infectious diseases in the past year, compared to 4.2 (4.1–4.4) in vaccinated children. Among 11- to 17-year-olds, the corresponding figures were 1.9 (1.0–2.8) (unvaccinated) versus 2.2 (2.1–2.3) (vaccinated).&quot;</p>

<p>What more possible information would you want by repeating this study Meryl?  The only difference found, after looking at over 13,000 children, is that the unvaccinated get more illnesses by vaccine preventable diseases.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not rocket science Meryl.  </p>

      <p>Don&#39;t forget this one, which suggests vaccinated kids in the Phillippines do better on cognitive tests than their unvaccinated counterparts: </p>

<p><a href="http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/pgda/WorkingPapers/2011/PGDA_WP_69.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/pgda/WorkingPapers/2011/PGDA_WP_69.pdf</a> (PDF file)</p>

<p>&quot;We find no effect of vaccination on later height or weight, but full childhood vaccination for measles, polio, TB, and DPT significantly increases cognitive test scores relative to matched children who received no vaccinations. The size of the effect is large, raising test scores, on average, by about half a standard deviation.&quot;

      <p>And the Philipino one:
<br /><a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00036846.2011.566203?journalCode=raec20#.UvMhnnnT3V0" rel="nofollow">http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00036846.2011.566203?journalCode=raec20#.UvMhnnnT3V0</a></p>

<p>&quot;We find no effect of vaccination on later height or weight, but full childhood vaccination for measles, polio, Tuberculosis (TB), Diphtheria, Pertussis and Tetanus (DPT) significantly increases cognitive test scores relative to matched children who received no vaccinations. The size of the effect is large, raising test scores, on average, by about half an SD.&quot;</p>

<p>So the vaccinated population show higher cognitive scores.  You could argue this is selection bias, but otherwise you could claim that they are just more clever to get vaccinated.</p>

<p>What else would your proposed study show, Meryl?</p>

      <p>Oh no, John and Shelley: neither of those studies exist. Anti-vaxxers keep telling me so.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why we apparently need a study using the Medicare data, i.e. using frequency of doctor visits as a proxy measure for health. Such a study would &quot;demonstrate once and for all&quot; that *drumroll* parents who distrust the medical profession so much that they refuse to vaccinate also don&#39;t take their kids to the GP. I wouldn&#39;t be making room on the mantle for that Nobel on that basis.</p>

        <p>Patrick - you keep calling people anti-vaxxers as if that actually meant anything. It doesn&#39;t. There are those who accept what they are told about this medical issue and those who are sceptical and require better information. You are in the first group - I am in the second.</p>

      <p>Patrick - you keep calling people anti-vaxxers as if that actually meant anything. It doesn&#39;t. There are those who accept what they are told about this medical issue and those who are sceptical and require better information. You are in the first group - I am in the second.</p>

<p>The ACIR links with the medicare database and all illnesses which are charged through Medicare are coded. So we have 3 groups - those who are fully vaccinated - those who are completely unvaccinated - and those who are partially vaccinated.</p>

<p>Looking at the database, we can discover (for example) the rate of asthma diagnoses in each group, or ASDs, or eczema or diabetes, cancer - anything really. So it&#39;s not just the frequency of doctor visits such a study would ascertain (though that might be interesting in and of itself). We would like to know the actual health status. If one group has a higher level of acute and chronic diseases, that would give us a pretty good indication of the overall health status. And if that difference was substantial - well, as a parent yourself, wouldn&#39;t you want to know that? Or is that also information we aren&#39;t entitled to?</p>

      <p>And again, how do you plan to correct for parents who just plain don&#39;t take their kids to the doctor and/or don&#39;t present at the doctor for certain things? How do you expect this data to evaluate the health of a cohort whose parents have an aversion to interacting with the very data-collection system you&#39;re relying on?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have any problem with people who are &quot;sceptical and require better information.&quot; That, after all, is how the collective knowledge of our species progresses. I do, however, have a problem with people who don&#39;t accept the limits of what they are and are not capable of evaluating on their own.</p>

      <p>Meryl - you keep calling yourself &quot;sceptical&quot; as if it means you evaluate available evidence to make a reasoned decision about vaccination and want to align yourself with a group that is already respected by government and media in Australia. </p>

      <p>Is this the perfect way to catch every single child who has a health problem? No, of course it&#39;s not. But is it basic science that will give a very good indication of whether or not there is a difference (positive or negative) between these three cohorts? Yes, it is. And it is basic science that has never been done and really needs to be studied. And Patrick - believe it or not, just because you might say no to vaccines, it does not necessarily mean you never see doctors. I don&#39;t believe you know much about this cohort of families. So while many parents may not take their children for medical treatment if they have a cold or flu, I think it&#39;s fair to say that most if not all of them would seek out a medical opinion for cancer, asthma or diabetes. So this would be a very valid study indeed.</p>

<p>Also, how dare you try to evaluate what others (most of whom you don&#39;t know and have never met) are capable of evaluating? That is not only arrogant - it is ignorant as well. And rude. </p>

      <p>Here is Meryl Dorey trying to evaluate what others (most of whom she doesn&#39;t know and has never met) are capable of evaluating:</p>

<p>&quot;“It is true that oftentimes, our information will contradict the conclusions or summaries of the studies.

      <p>Meryl, the study you suggest doing (using medicare data to make a comparison between groups that quite clearly access health care differently) is grossly flawed due to a problem known as selection bias.</p>

<p>Your inability to grasp this concept when it is pointed out to you demonstrates that you, simply put, don&#39;t understand some of the simplest concepts of study design.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t need your lack of qualifications as a demonstration that you don&#39;t know what you are talking about. Your suggestions prove that in spectacular fashion.</p>

<p>By the way, I pointed out that German study for you a while back, and you *still* claimed today that such a study didn&#39;t exist. Is this dishonesty, or is your memory really that short?</p>

      <p>Meryl, for someone who has apparently done 20+ years of research on vaccination, and been reminded multiple times that these studies exist, I remain surprised that you still don&#39;t appear to know they have been done. Are you pretending they don&#39;t exist because you are simply not happy with the results? </p>

<p>If indeed this is the case, then may I suggest you conduct your own research? (and no, I don&#39;t mean &quot;Googling&quot;). After all, you have in the past collected money (some reports suggest tens of thousands over the years), some of which was for the express purpose of conducting vaccine studies, no? What happened to those funds? What happened to the money you collected to examine the levels of heavy metals in vaccines? Are you still planning on doing this? </p>

      <p>Meryl,
<br />Above are more than enough large studies comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated, and autistic to non-autistic children.  They found no link between vaccination and autism.  
<br />More than that though, as you asked, the largest studies have found that vaccinated children suffer less disease, and score better on cognitive scores.  Why would you want to repeat this study?  What on earth do you think you&#39;ll find?
<br />John</p>

      <p>&quot;I think it&#39;s fair to say that most if not all of them would seek out a medical opinion for cancer, asthma or diabetes. So this would be a very valid study indeed.&quot; </p>

<p>- Given (as I understand it) Medicare data doesn&#39;t actually record diagnoses, I&#39;d be very interested to know how your study is going to derive e.g. &#39;has asthma&#39; from &#39;saw the doctor twice.&#39; Your study couldn&#39;t tell us anything beyond how regularly vaccinated and unvaccinated kids go to the doctor, which, given its dependent upon parental behaviour, doesn&#39;t tell us much about their health. So, we&#39;ve got a study that&#39;s already been done, only now we&#39;re going to do it in a way that actually tells us nothing. But it might allow you to assert &quot;a study shows that vaccinated kids go to the doctor more than unvaccinated kids&quot; and it technically be true.</p>

<p>&quot;Also, how dare you try to evaluate what others (most of whom you don&#39;t know and have never met) are capable of evaluating?&quot;</p>

<p>- Not much daring involved, really: if a particular area requires specialised study in order to evaluate its claims, then those who don&#39;t have that study are not capable of doing so. Nothing to do with their intelligence, good sense or anything else, which obviously varies enormously from person to person. Simple matter of who&#39;s done the necessary training. I do realise some of your followers (and I&#39;ll do you the courtesy of assuming you don&#39;t share this view) basically reject every tenet of medical science and therefore the idea that such training matters. Like I say, good sense is highly variable across individuals. </p>

<p>&quot;That is not only arrogant - it is ignorant as well. And rude&quot;</p>

<p>- Well that&#39;s interesting. You know what I find arrogant, ignorant and rude? People insisting that they know more about an area than people who have dedicated their lives to studying it and practicing it professionally. I find that incredibly arrogant. And silly.</p>

      <p>how do new borns get these diseases? they never get immunised right away ,anyway , but usually spend their time until then  not interacting with the general public, overseas migrants have seldom vaccinated their kids. they would be a bigger problem than the odd person who doesnt vaccinate....people who thought  it caused autism did believe in vaccination, just not in having them all together ! a lot of you shoulde work out what you are talking about before trolling people!

      <p>How do new-borns get these diseases?  They contract them from an infected other person, for which there may not need to be direct physical contact between the two.</p>

<p>To minimise risk of newborn contracting the disease, as close to uniform vaccination coverage as can be achieved seems to be effective.  </p>

      <p>newborns are never given the vaccination! they have to be a few months old .that means there has always been a gap../.. newborns dont go out much and when they do they dont interact very much .they are sposed to have immunity from their mums for the first couple of months.unless members of the family haven&#39;t been immunised.... and even then they shouldn&#39;t be vulnerable! they have usually been done by the time they become vulnerable. it seems like you are making things up to keep up your argument !

      <p>Ms Hatfield, my argument is SOMETHING THAT I HAVE BEEN TOLD.</p>

<p>Until and unless someone such as Ms Dorey refers data to confirm that incidence of disease in children too young to be vaccinated is COMPLETELY INDEPENDENT of immunisation rates in older children, then argument through incredulity is insufficient.</p>

      <p>It appears that you are confused as to what vaccines are for. A truer test of the utility of vaccines is to compare the rates of contracted disease (and/or severity of such disease) from a vaccinated cohort to an unvaccinated cohort.  A second test is to compare the rate and severity of adverse reactions compared to the the death/morbidity rate of the unvaccinated.</p>

<p>These tests were first done back in the days of the first vaccines and, unsurprisingly,  it has been found that it vaccines are successful in reducing the incidence and severity of disease and that the rates of adverse effects (including, sadly death) is far, far less than the risk to the unvaccinated.</p>

<p>The only tangible risk to society from vaccination is to the sensibilities of those in the AVN, or whatever it is that you are forced to call yourselves these days.</p>

      <p>The author&#39;s suggestion doesn&#39;t seem to be dismissing non expert opinions, but requiring their proponents to back the up with valid arguments. The Media Watch anti vaccination response is a perfect example. Claiming that the ABC is stifling scientific debate, when one cannot make a valid scientific argument, is the problem.</p>

      <p>Thank you Patrick for your thoughtful reflection on this issue.</p>

<p>Keith - I agree that we need to tolerate - indeed, encourage - dissenting views that allow our own ideas to be tested and refined. Patrick states that &quot;You are only entitled to what you can argue for.” And I think that&#39;s the important distinction, especially in public discourse. It should be possible to argue for &quot;valid dissenting views&quot;... but not for bulldust. And that&#39;s the issue with the Australian Vaccination Network arguments - they&#39;re not defensible.</p>

      <p>Louise, I agree, of course some so-called arguments are bulldust. </p>

<p>But the interesting question is what do &#39;we&#39; do about bulldust arguments. </p>

<p>Is it just about me saying &#39;That&#39;s rubbish, I&#39;m not going to listen&#39; to an acquaintance? Or should tutors prevent students from speaking in tutorials? Or should the ABC not air a view that a certain percentage of scientists disagree with? </p>

      <p>I think the best course of action is to make clear that what is being aired is indeed a subjective opinion by a person or persons without expertise in the subject matter. This would be appropriate in the vaccination example (and in fact I suspect if that point is to be made clear, I expect the media outlet would seriously reconsider airing the view at all).</p>

<p>In the case of something a certain amount of scientists disagree with, this is a different matter. The view by group A and group B can both be aired as long as both are views by people qualified to take part. So for example in the climate science debate, that would mean climate scientists taking part in either side of the debate, not bloggers, social commentators or politicians (as mentioned in the article, the politicians can stick to arguing the policies not the science). </p>

      <p>scientists are not always right, and have a tendency to go with the most popular theories....well, at least be influenced by them.  we should not treat them as gods ,take ideas on mental health for instance. and admit that sometimes the public can have a good idea.i can remember reading womens mags in the early 60s. we were told mental illness could not be inherited . neither could cancer. they were dispelling the old wives tales that were common in the general public. it has since been proved that these things can be inherited through having certain genes. the public had noticed that some diseases recurred in some families. the scientists jumped on the bandwagon of there being no mechanism by which this could happen, just because they didn&#39;t know any better and refused to believe the public could possibly know anything!</p>

      <p>No you&#39;re right Lee scientists are not always right but they are never - never - proved wrong by myths and superstition and fantasies - they are proved wrong by better science.   </p>

<p>Now sometimes we can indeed find some elements of truth in &quot;old wives tales&quot; as you put it ... but again these truths if they exist are proved by scientific inquiry and assessment - not by beliefs and hopes of the faithful.</p>

      <p>Justin, I think everyone agrees that if there are truly informed and opposing opinions we want to hear them and keep hearing them as they are proven or disproved but once the preponderance of evidence is in- someone needs to have the good grace to admit that their premise was wrong on the available data and go gather something substantial to resurrect it- if it is even possible or let it die. </p>

      <p>I love the reasoning here and will share this piece with my Year 12 English students.  It will challenge their thinking and highlight the importance of  justifying opinions with evidence.  Anything that encourages active learning and thinking is a positive. It may just be my skewed perspective but I fear, as a society, we give too much credence to flawed and superficial thinking, and the opinions that come from it.</p>

      <p>For a philosopher like Patrick Stokes to claim that people are not entitled to express an opinion (or even to reference that opinion with published, scientific evidence) is tantamount to censorship. </p>

<p>ABC’s Media Watch program, presented a hatchet job piece called False Balance Leads to Confusion, attacking WIN Television for presenting both sides of the vaccination issue in a recent report on a measles outbreak in NSW. Because the interview contained information from both a medical community spokesperson and myself, representing the Australian Vaccination Network, Inc. (AVN), Media Watch called it a “false balance”. They called the AVN’s information “baloney” and said that the AVN’s data, much of which is  sourced from peer-reviewed medical journals, is “bulldust”</p>

<p>To WIN Television’s credit, their spokesperson said:</p>

<p>    The story presented was accurate, fair and balanced and presented the views of the medical practitioners and of the choice groups.
<br />    — Shirley Brown, Group Business Director, 4th September, 2012</p>

<p>What proof did Jonathan Holmes, the current host of Media Watch, provide for his assertions about the quality and veracity of the AVN’s information? Absolutely none. What proof has Patrick Stokes provided on the same question? Absolutely none.</p>

<p>Did either commentator reference any of the peer-reviewed articles linking vaccines with autism and minimal brain damage or mention the cases where courts listened to expert testimony and paid compensation to families whose children developed autism as a result of vaccination? No.</p>

<p>One might have thought that a philosopher would have supported open access to information. One could be excused for believing that they would have supported healthcare consumers in their search for balanced information.</p>

<p>The AVN has never asked for a stifling or suppression of any information in this nearly 250-year old debate. In fact, we have openly asked for more public debate, leaving the final choice up to those who are the real stakeholders in this issue – the parents of Australia’s children. To knowingly withhold information on an issue of science which is far from proven (since vaccines are never scientifically tested using real control groups and true placebos – the gold-standard of medical testing) is not only wrong – it is unscientific. The medical community itself considers vaccination to be a controversial issue with tens of thousands of medical professionals worldwide questioning the evidence base for vaccine safety and effectiveness.</p>

<p>Organisations such as the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, the International Medical Council on Vaccination and other doctor and specialist-based bodies around the world say that the jury is still out on the safety and effectiveness of current government mass-vaccination policies.</p>

<p>It’s time to break the silence and not just allow but encourage the debate. Patrick, perhaps you could help me to find someone from within the medical or scientific community who will debate me on these issues in a public venue. After all, if my information is so devoid of evidence and so fallacious, you would think that medicos and public health officials would be champing at the bit to prove both myself and the AVN wrong. But instead, they consistently refuse to debate me whilst insisting that everything stated by both myself and the organisation is incorrect. Pretty cowardly, don&#39;t you think? So put your philosophy where your passion is and instead of trying to shut me up - help to prove how very wrong I am by getting someone to debate me in a public venue with a moderator who is not aligned with either viewpoint on this issue.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance,
<br />Meryl Dorey</p>

      <p>Good to see Ms Dorey reinforce the central tenets of the article by citing discredited anti-vaccination organisations such as AAPS and IMCV *sigh*.</p>

<p>I was also hoping Ms Dorey would pull out her list of *proofs*.</p>

<p>Luckily, these *proofs* have already been addressed here:</p>

<p><a href="http://landlockedseaotter.com/2012/10/02/the-avns-response-to-media-watch-and-why-its-wrong/" rel="nofollow">http://landlockedseaotter.com/2012/10/02/the-avns-response-to-media-watch-and-why-its-wrong/</a></p>

<p>Thank you for such a clear demonstration of the need for Patrick Stokes&#39; article, and the accuracy of Jonathan Holmes&#39; statements on Media Watch.</p>

      <p>Also, Ms Dorey includes this comedic comment: &quot;The AVN has never asked for a stifling or suppression of any information in this nearly 250-year old debate. In fact, we have openly asked for more public debate,&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, that&#39;s why there are over 200 people banned from AVN fora, most of whom were only sharing accurate information, politely.</p>

      <p>&quot;For a philosopher like Patrick Stokes to claim that people are not entitled to express an opinion ...  is tantamount to censorship.&quot;</p>

<p>Thanks for the astro-turfing, Meryl!</p>

<p>But referring back to Patrick&#39;s piece, you will find this that your position is indefensible.</p>

<p>Patrick is not suggesting that you have no right to express your opinion, only that you have no right to be taken seriously. i.e., I acknowledge respectfully that you believe P. But as P is a great steaming pile of nonsense I do not have to respect the opinion. See the difference?</p>

<p>&quot;...perhaps you could help me to find someone from within the medical or scientific community who will debate me on these issues in a public venue.&quot;</p>

<p>Here is a better option, Meryl. Do some science. The only &quot;debate&quot; worth having is the one in the scientific literature - the one you seem to be losing.</p>

      <p>Geoffrey Edwards - you say - &quot;Thanks for the astro-turfing, Meryl!&quot;</p>

<p>I believe you need to look up the definition for astroturfing - it&#39;s possible you may have used it incorrectly here, at least according to my reading.</p>

<p>And a debate using the scientific literature is the one I am and have been asking for. My peer-reviewed references vs yours. Are you volunteering to debate me, Geoffrey? That would be wonderful! Please let me know and we can get together and set a time, date and place.</p>

<p>Thanks,

      <p>&quot;it&#39;s possible you may have used it incorrectly here&quot;</p>

<p>On the accepted definition, yes. I used it ironically. I have this image of you sitting at home googling your name every 5 minutes so that you can spam discussions. Kind of sad really.</p>

<p>&quot;And a debate using the scientific literature is the one I am and have been asking for.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, but science is not a debate about competing value claims. If the evidence doesn&#39;t support your premise their is nothing to debate.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you volunteering to debate me, Geoffrey? That would be wonderful! Please let me know and we can get together and set a time, date and place.&quot;</p>

<p>Wow. Moral grandstanding. You challenge me to a debate. I decline because I have no interest in talking about your particular vision of reality. You claim the win beacuse I am &quot;too scared&quot; to debate you. Good for you.</p>

<p>There is nothing worth debating.</p>

You may recall that when the NSW Health Care Complaints Commission asked you to explain why you had misquoted the conclusions in some science papers, you said:</p>

<p>“It  is true that oftentimes, our information will contradict the conclusions or summaries of the studies. This is because, as opposed to most doctors and government officials, we actually read the studies and frequently, the summary and conclusion does not agree with the raw data itself. It is as if there were a disconnect between the findings of the study and the research itself.</p>

<p>“Many times, that disconnect can be explained by the financial links between the study&#39;s researchers and the companies whose products are being studied. So, whilst the AVN does frequently draw different conclusions to those printed at the end of these articles, it is because our analysis of the data shows that the printed conclusions do not correspond with the raw data. This is not selective reporting - it is accurate reporting.”</p>

<p>Of course, as anyone here would know, the &quot;raw data&quot; is not included in the publication, so how did you access it?  The answer is that you did not.</p>

      <p>Dear Meryl (if I may),</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to comment, and I apologise that’ll have to be a bit brief right now (I’ll be in a workshop all day today, but will check in again here this evening).</p>

<p>As you’ll see from the article, I did not say that people are not entitled to express an opinion – indeed I clearly affirmed that everyone can think and say what they like. Hence to suggest I’m endorsing censorship involves the same confusion between being-entitled-to-speak and being-entitled-to-be-taken-seriously that I discuss in the article. To suggest I don’t support ‘open access to information’ is similarly false. What I don’t support is treating all available information as equally valid.</p>

<p>You ask what proof Jonathan Holmes offered and what proof I offer that your assertions are false. As far as I know, Holmes doesn’t have any relevant qualifications, and neither do I. So I’m not going to argue the science with you, as I’m simply not qualified to do that. That is, essentially, my whole point. Without the relevant training, I haven’t earned a basis on which to think I could evaluate claims made in as complex a field as immunology. Any scientific opinions I could form have no claim to credibility. My only qualification on that topic is that I have a brain, and that’s not qualification enough to tell scientists they’re wrong about science.</p>

<p>Now, here’s where you and I *are* entitled to have opinions, and to have those opinions taken seriously: we’re citizens, and as such policy responses to science are very much our business. Should vaccines be compulsory? How are individual autonomy and collective welfare to be weighed against each other? What risks are acceptable and what are not? What rights does a parent have over the health-care decisions of their children? These are all interesting and important questions, and they’re questions you’re more than entitled to present strong views over. But when you or I stray into the science itself, we’re getting into territory where we can’t expect our views to carry any weight. </p>

<p>Best wishes,
<br />Patrick</p>

      <p>&quot;Pretty cowardly, don&#39;t you think? So put your philosophy where your passion is and instead of trying to shut me up&quot;</p>

<p>You would know only too well what it takes to act in this manner, wouldn&#39;t you Meryl? The extremely tight control you exercise over who and what opinions or arguments are allowed on all of your web forums is so legendary, one could be forgiven for thinking you cut your teeth in journalism at Pravda during the Cold War.</p>

<p>And all the while, you complain about being silenced. Amazing.</p>

<p>&quot;Wow. Moral grandstanding. You challenge me to a debate. I decline because I have no interest in talking about your particular vision of reality. You claim the win beacuse I am &quot;too scared&quot; to debate you. Good for you.&quot;</p>

<p>You said that science was about facts and yet you refuse to debate me because you have no interest in taling about my &quot;particular vision of reality&quot;. I&#39;m not asking you to debate my vision of reality. I&#39;m asking you to debate the evidence. Now surely, if you are so assured that your evidence is superior, you should be happy to debate someone who hasn&#39;t quite got your grasp on this issue. </p>

<p>You can&#39;t be saying that your evidence is superior &#39;because you said so&#39;, are you Geoffrey? That didn&#39;t work with my parents and it certainly won&#39;t work with me. If we are talking about science, then your evidence against mine - how about it? Debate me.</p>

      <p>Meryl&#39;s style of debate means she provides the opponent with two options:</p>

<p>1 Take her seriously as if anything she has to say is legitimate, valid or useful.
<br />2 Refuse to do that - and be accused of censorship, suppression, grandstanding etc.</p>

<p>Meryl, your sense that you are worthy of inclusion is a public scientific vaccination debate is delusional on two counts.</p>

<p>A) You are not worthy
<br />B) There is no scientific for/against vaccination debate.</p>

<p>I am not censoring debate - I am declining to participate because I deem that particular debate to have no merit and, just like you, I am not a scientist. Unlike you, I don&#39;t pick and choose the science I am willing to accept. </p>

<p>&quot;I cannot interpret what you&#39;ve said in any other way but would love to hear your alternative explanation.&quot;</p>

<p>- I will assume this is mere rhetorical strategy rather than make any assumptions about your lack of imagination.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m asking you to debate the evidence.&quot;</p>

<p>- The evidence is not up for debate. Only the inferences drawn from that evidence.</p>

<p>&quot;Now surely, if you are so assured that your evidence is superior, you should be happy to debate someone who hasn&#39;t quite got your grasp on this issue.&quot;</p>

<p>- Why are you sure I would be interested in debating someone inferior to me?</p>

<p>&quot;You can&#39;t be saying that your evidence is superior &#39;because you said so&#39;, are you Geoffrey?&quot;</p>

<p>No. I am not becuase it is not &quot;my&quot; evidence in opposition to &quot;your&quot; evidence. </p>

<p>&quot;If we are talking about science, then your evidence against mine - how about it?&quot;</p>

<p>- No, Meryl. The evidence is the evidence. Again, you don&#39;t understand. Fact&#39;s do not negate other fact&#39;s. Logical inference is the issue. The same evidence can be interpreted in different ways to a given conclusion P. P is either true or false. P is the item of debate, not the evidence.</p>

<br />Yes, policy responses to science are very much our business, and it’s the duty of our political representatives to respond to citizens’ questions in this regard.  
<br />By way of example, in June this year I forwarded a detailed letter to the Federal Health Minister, Tanya Plibersek, in which I questioned the Government’s arbitrary requirement that children be vaccinated twice with the measles/mumps/rubella (MMR) vaccine, as it is likely most children will already have lifelong immunity after the first dose.  My letter can be accessed via this link: <a href="http://users.on.net/~peter.hart/Letter_to_Minister_Plibersek_re_MMR_vaccine.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://users.on.net/~peter.hart/Letter_to_Minister_Plibersek_re_MMR_vaccine.pdf</a>   The letter was also copied to a range of relevant experts, including Professor Terry Nolan, Chair, Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI).
<br />I received no response from the Minister’s office and I followed up on the matter last week.  I have been advised that the Minister’s office will not respond to my letter.  No argument, no nothing.

      <p>omnipotent? Censor a debate? Lol, as soon as you don&#39;t get your way, you&#39;re always being &quot;censored&quot; or &quot;bullied&quot;, aren&#39;t you, Meryl? When are you just going to face the fact that actual academics, and the people that are smarter than you, consider you and your &quot;opinion&quot; a waste of time that could be better spent making more scientific discoveries, such as the REAL cause of autism?</p>

<p>All you&#39;re doing is asking for a debate on an issue that, in regular circles, has already been debated, and decided upon. In other words, the conversation you want to have.... we had that one long ago. It&#39;s just like if you asked to debate someone on the merits of heliocentricity - you would be laughed out of academia.</p>

      <p>Elizabeth, if it is your opinion that the NIP &#39;arbitrarily&#39; has two doses of MMR in the schedule - do you honestly think the addition of a second dose to the schedule (at incredible cost and resource cost) *hasn&#39;t* been thoroughly debated by the subject matter experts?</p>

<p>On a slightly different note, you claim in your letter that the emphasis should be on getting everyone vaccinated with one dose.
<br />Surely you understand the basic logistics of getting *every* child in Australia vaccinated with only one-dose on the schedule is pretty darn hard to do - combine that with the one-dose 5% failure to confer immunity and the vaccination coverage for one-dose on the schedule for MMR in Australia would be well below what is needed for herd immunity.</p>

<p>Adding a second dose to the schedule *is* maximising one-dose MMR coverage, it&#39;s ensuring the most opportunity for children to get at LEAST one-dose.</p>

      <p>Further to my previous comment, I also forwarded my letter querying the arbitrary second dose of the MMR vaccine to Meryl Dorey of the Australian Vaccination Network, Paul Arthur of the US National Vaccination Information Center, and John Stone of the Age of Autism.  None of these people have responded to my letter either.  
<br />It appears the argument I have put forward in my letter doesn’t fit the mindset of the Minister’s office, nor that of those who are perceived as the ‘anti-vaccination’ brigade.  As a result, I suspect parents are not being informed that there is an option of serological testing to verify a response to MMR vaccination for their child, i.e. evidence based medicine.  I understand serological testing costs around $50, and suggest there may be some parents who might prefer to pay for this option rather than have an arbitrary revaccination for their child.  But how many parents are informed about this?

      <p>Peter correct me if I am wrong, but it isnt expertise that is most relevant to an argument, it is evidence?
<br />My education is in medical sciences yet I understand your article and have raised such points in arguments before (just think of every time you have discussed climate change with a &#39;non believer&#39;).  Yet my lack of an education in philosophy does not make me wrong?</p>

<p>It may be Meryl Dorey&#39;s lack of scientific education that leads her to her indefensible beliefs, but it is really her lack of evidence that makes her wrong.  </p>

      <p>Rosco Hamilton, you say:</p>

<p>&quot;It may be Meryl Dorey&#39;s lack of scientific education that leads her to her indefensible beliefs, but it is really her lack of evidence that makes her wrong.&quot;</p>

<p>Evidence of what? You have made a very broad statement there, claiming that I have no evidence...but we need to be specific because otherwise, it just sounds like you have no evidence of my lack of evidence, if you take my point.</p>

<p>So please cite one particular thing which you think I have no evidence for and I can then provide you with evidence.</p>

<p>And this takes me back to the issue of a public debate. If you and everyone else here is so sure that I have no evidence to back up what I&#39;ve been saying for the last 20 years or so, then accept the challenge to debate me in public - my references against yours. By not accepting this, you are saying that you can&#39;t possible oppose my evidence and that is an admission that you have none.</p>

<p>Good grief, Meryl. Do you seriously think for just one moment that an unwillingness to attend a &quot;public debate&quot; by default is an admission that someone has no references or cannot oppose your evidence? This is like saying that the refusal of most credible scientists to debate creationists is a tacit admission that the scientific evidence shows the Earth really is only 6000 years old and puffed into existence over 7 days.</p>

<p>No, it simply means that your views are so fringe-dwelling that they&#39;re not considered worthy of genuine debate.</p>

      <p>Meryl, just because someone does not want to debate you, does not mean that you are correct. How many NASA scientists do you see debating idiots that believe that the moon landings didn&#39;t happen? How many geologists do you see debating &quot;flat Earthers&quot;? </p>

<p>None. </p>

<p>Why give someone like you a platform alongside actual experts? </p>

<p>You are a frothing fringe dweller. The only difference between your opinion and those of a flat Earther is that your views are dangerous to our society. </p>

You have a monopoly on the truth - end of story - no need to look any further or to use science at all because you know the answer to every question.</p>

<p>The only thing that is dangerous here Scott is your assertion that there are no valid questions about either the safety or effectiveness of vaccines. It is that sort of non-reasoning which saw drugs like Vioxx, Thalidomide, Avandia and more kill and maim hundreds of thousands of people before anything was done. Because again, the &#39;scientists&#39; thought they had all the answers and therefore, any questions that were asked must have been both unscientific and &#39;fringe&#39;.</p>

<p>Your arrogance and the arrogance of those who oppose a transparent and balanced debate on this or any scientific issue is the real danger. If you are so sure of your data - debate it. Let everyone see both sides and decide for themselves. Unless you have something to hide, that is.</p>

<p>Again - science is not decided by debate. It is decided by evidence. You have been shown to be wrong on nearly everything you have ever dribbled on the internet. One must wonder why you decide to continue in such a way, especially on an article that explains in detail why your opinion is wrong - only giving us yet more evidence that you clearly lack the expertise to evaluate the science in any meaningful way. </p>

<p>So no, my argument is not ridiculous. You are a fringe dweller, as are all anti vaxers. Your opinion (without the evidence, and without the relevant qualifications) means absolutely nothing in comparison to the people that actually know what they are talking about. </p>

<p>Research and adding that research to the pool of knowledge is where the arena is. Just because you don&#39;t like the way its done, doesn&#39;t mean everyone should dumb down for you.</p>

<p>Yes. By all means ask questions, hold an opinion, but don&#39;t think for a second any scientist would take them seriously if those questions are sufficiently answered.</p>

<p>I also wonder what you think a one-on-one public debate would achieve? One scientist vs one &#39;lady from NSW&#39; isnt going to rock the foundations of vaccination knowledge in any sense. 
<br />You also continue to assume scientists dont have the information you have either? They have Google too.
<br />Then when people do take the time to read the references and &#39;do the research&#39; you don&#39;t like their answers - so continue on your merry way (ie Tom Sidwell (PhD candidate in immunology, did just that!)</p>

<p>A debate is merely a publicity stunt because YOU like the attention. Nothing more. It achieves nothing.</p>

<p>If you cant participate where the &#39;debate&#39; really exists (in the peer reviewed journals) dont stamp your feet and demand that it be brought to your level. The bar is high. You just cant reach it.</p>

      <p>&quot;Who are you to determine what is valuable to debate and what is not? Are you omnipotent or do you feel that your opinion is so much more valid then someone else&#39;s and that validity entitles you to censor a debate? I cannot interpret what you&#39;ve said in any other way but would love to hear your alternative explanation.&quot;</p>

<p>There you go again Meryl using that word &quot;censorship&quot; again. Censorship has nothing to do with this. The issue is fraud. You pretend to run a legitimate vaccination information service. You don&#39;t. You pretend to know what you are talking about with regard to; immunology, interpretation of scientific papers, correlation &amp; causality, health statistics and logical reasoning. You don&#39;t. As an immunology expert / public commentator Meryl, you fail. You lack the knowledge, skills, qualifications, intelligence - and as much as anything else - the humility to be taken in any way seriously on the topic of vaccination health. Go and farm your nuts.</p>

      <p>Now before you pair come to fisticuffs we are lucky.  We can easily get first hand eyeball to eyeball experience of a non-vaccinated population.  No shortage of them in fact.  A sort of &quot;Go back to where you came from&quot; doco of a tour package to a few virally challenged communities. Heaps of unvaccinated populations in Africa, India, South America ... An live experiment, in fact.</p>

<p>Not often one can do such an experiment.  Who&#39;s up for that?</p>

      <p>&quot;So because you and many within the mainstream medical professions don&#39;t agree with my data - most of which is sourced from within the mainstream medical profession....&quot;</p>

<p>It&#39;s not &quot;your&quot; data Meryl. It&#39;s *their* data. You are not the one who conducts the trials, the investigations, the lab research. You are not the one who studies disease-causing pathogens using an electron microscope. You are not the one who takes the lab notes. You are not the one processing blood samples through a centrifuge, or performing the DNA analyses, or designing experiments. You don&#39;t writeup the research results, and you don&#39;t review them prior to publishing.</p>

<p>The reason for this is that you are unlikely to know a leukocyte from a platelet or a bacteria from a virus if they were presented on a slide in front of you. You demonstrated earlier on this thread that even your concept of a &quot;placebo&quot; is rather vague (see your &quot;true placebo&quot; comment). How then can you claim, as you seem to do, that all these vaccine and immunology research results really should&#39;ve been interpreted differently?</p>

<p>It was not an &quot;cold fusion awareness&quot; facebook group which proved the cold fusion experiments flawed many years ago. It was other scientists. It was not a rag-tag bunch of bloggers who overturned conventional wisdom on peptic ulcers. It was two scientists who did the hard research and experiments themselves, and scored a Nobel Prize for it. It was not an &quot;anti-faster-than-the-speed-of-light&quot; lobby group which proved the Large Hadron Collider experiment showing neutrinos travelling faster that the speed of light was flawed. It was the same scientists who conducted the original experiment! It wasn&#39;t an activist housewife from Bangalow who first suspected and later proved the link between Thalidomide and birth defects. It was two mainstream doctors and a pharmacologist, and they were widely recognised and awarded later for their work.</p>

<p>More than 20 years on and you have no such recognition. Why not? Scientific credibility, Meryl. You need to find some. Exhaustive research which withstands the intense scrutiny of your fellow scientists, Meryl. You need to do some.</p>

      <p>Meryl,
<br />Time and time again I&#39;ve accepted your challenge to a debate on your own terms, on your own website, with your own moderator, and each and every time you&#39;ve backed away like a coward.  Every time you&#39;ve been shown to be making false claims you&#39;ve found some excuse to withdraw.
<br />It shows you have nothing.  Your evidence?  I claim you have nothing.  Why?  Because otherwise real scientists would be agreeing with you.  and they don&#39;t.

      <p>John Cunningham - I can smell something burning and I think it&#39;s your pants. You know perfectly well (and if you&#39;ve forgotten, I have the documentary evidence to prove this) that my offer has always been for a live debate in front of an audience so the parents can hear and participate. YOU are the one who has always refused this even though I&#39;ve offered an independent moderator, to pay for the venue myself, to share questions and references in advance so there won&#39;t be any surprises...but even though this is so fair, you have consistently refused. So if there is anyone running scared here John, it&#39;s you.</p>

      <p>Meryl, you are the one that consistently lies and tries to change tack every time you face John in comment. I hardly think that someone that has an *actual* grounding in science, more importantly medicine - has anything to fear from someone that lives on the fringes of pseudoscience and dangerous woo. </p>

      <p>Dear Meryl,
<br />Thanks so much for your mature and considerate reply.  You set up the website, and you chose the moderator.  What could be more public than a website, where people can read the debate, do their own research, and assess the claims of the debaters?  What could lead to a better understanding of the issues than a place where your claims can be investigated, in each person&#39;s own time?  I&#39;m all for it Meryl, but you&#39;re the one that always finds an excuse not to take part.  I can&#39;t blame you though.  I would prefer a town hall argument too after your last efforts on the debate site.  Town halls are good for politics, good for the &quot;sound bite&quot;, but not good for education and science Meryl.
<br />You know where you&#39;ll find me.
<br />John</p>

      <p>Meryl. Your stupid. It burns. Geoffrey perfectly sums it up
<br />&quot; No, Meryl. The evidence is the evidence. Again, you don&#39;t understand. Fact&#39;s do not negate other fact&#39;s. Logical inference is the issue. The same evidence can be interpreted in different ways to a given conclusion P. P is either true or false. P is the item of debate, not the evidence&quot;
<br />You seem to have no grasp of the scientific method whatsoever. That in itself is worrying enough, because you seem to hold something of an influential position. Moreover, the fact that you blatantly disregard study after study that disproves the fact that autism is related to vaccinations is more worrying. It is willful ignorance and cannot be tolerated. By entering yourself into a scientific debate with a complete lack of qualifications or a scientific foundation is akin to bringing a knife to a gun fight. Things won&#39;t go well for you..</p>

There is a significant number of parents with children who have ASD symptoms who believe that their child&#39;s symptoms arose or increased following a vaccination experience. That&#39;s a fact. </p>

<p>I&#39;ll give you another fact: the more we are learning about mammalian physiology, the more we realize how much we just can&#39;t yet explain. I hold open the possibility that, if science continues to advance at its present rate, we will find that some vaccination of some children in some circumstances carries with it a greater risk of ASDs. It is possible, even likely, that the main cause may not be the vaccination but that the stress of the vaccination on the child&#39;s already-fragile microbiome may be the one of a number of possible events that tipped that child into exhibiting ASD symptoms.</p>

<p>There is a worrying degree of dogmatism in some of the comments critical of Craig, Meryl and others. This is more redolent of amateurs supporting the establishment view of climate change or of &quot;controlled burning&quot; or of mainstream doctors treating stomach ulcers pre-Marshall than it is of scientific debate the way it is supposed to be conducted.  </p>

<p>There is also a degree of fury and some participants appear to be enjoying kicking heads of those they disagree with. It must be tough being a Meryl, logging on to the computer in the morning for another day at the office.</p>

      <p>The ture issue of diagreement here arises NOT from these facts about vaccination but rather the psychological fact that people in general have a tendancy that sometimes works against logic. That is- when two thinks happen together in time, especially if they are somehow linked together in time for many people - everybody had the inclination to believe that those two things MUST be causally linked. They are not.</p>

<p>It is just like when a phobia arises when a child is stomping their foot and ligthning strikes. Those two things cannot be scientifically linked but try telling that kid that.</p>

<p>One of my own twin sons got a call to tell him he had won a bike just as he was carving an apple. To him now, apples are lucky. Right.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to understand the physiology of inflammation and immunity. WHen you say &quot;the stress of the vaccination on the child&#39;s already-fragile microbiome...&quot;, what do you mean by &quot;stress&quot;. Are you aware that vaccination allows the child to form immunity to an organism without the &quot;stress&quot; of having to survive a full infection?</p>

<p>I suspect a lot of the reaction you are seeing here to some of the anti-vaccination commenters relates at least as much to the extreme views they have repeatedly promoted elsewhere as it does to what they have said here.</p>

<p>I sometimes wonder how someone like you would be received if  you stood up to defend these views in a country where children die of diseases that we never see now. If you, as a citizen of a rich country, who may well have survived childhood because of compulsary vaccination, I wonder what they would think. I wonder what they would say to you.</p>

<p>I grew up in a really hippie area. I am so glad my parents never came under the influence of your sort of thinking. I grew up healthy. My siblings grew up healthy.  My friends grew up healthy. And because they vaccinated their children, your children and children of those who think like you, are protected. You really should be thanking us for that.</p>

      <p>Nicely said Patrick - the only point on which I would disagree is your early comment that it is the job of philosophy teachers to teach their students how to construct and defend an argument.  I would respectfully suggest that this is a job for all teachers.  We should all be versed in the dialectic - thesis, antithesis, synthesis.  Thanks for reminding us of the importance of argument.</p>

      <p>Entitlements.  Seems to be the word for the week doesn&#39;t it?  Those who heard David Murray denouncing our &quot;addiction to welfare entitlements&quot; on TV last week might notice that this entitlement to fact-free opinions was not one of his complaints.</p>

<p>This notion that the opinions of the ignorant, the delusional, the paranoid and the self-interested have equal validity and weight to those with an informed perspective is rather new.  I blame the interweb.  And post-modernism relativism of course. And the mass meeja.</p>

<p>This idea that opinions are equal to facts, that we can find &quot;facts&quot; on-line to fit our opinions like a sock - or that we can invent our own facts to suit -  seems to be a product of the media age and the era of celebrity.</p>

<p>I wonder what Kim Kardassian thinks about global warming.  That&#39;ll do me.</p>

      <p>&quot;I blame the interweb&quot; - you&#39;re more right than you think, it is the internet.  </p>

<p>the web is the biggest change in the under-pinning technology of civilization since phoenician phonetic literacy displaced the archaic oral culture of homer &amp; the poets, replacing it with the classical, visual world of plato, aristotle, the academy -  the beginnings of rational thinking and its institutional &amp; technological support systems.  bigger than gutenberg&#39;s moveable type invention &amp; the unemployment of scribes.</p>

<p>massive social change is being wrought today, by new underlying communication technology of our time, the internet.  it is not print that has got us here, it is not photography, it is electricity.  this was inherent in the convergence of satellite telephony &amp; computers in the sixties. </p>

<p>it is bigger than moving our institutions, our data, publications, etc. on to &quot;the cloud&quot;.  its a fundamental challenge to these &amp; the values they sustain &amp; are in turn sustained by.  its a fundamental challenge, because it has displaced the centrality of the visual, eye-grounded values of phonetic literacy technology of the last 2000 years, replacing these with the tribal, acoustic, ear-grounded, electronic technology of the internet.</p>

<p>under conditions of speed of light massive information transfers, the social values &amp; institutions of linear rationality are challenged everywhere as we enter every day further into an &quot;acoustic space that has the basic character of a sphere whose focus or centre is simultaneously everywhere and whose margin is nowhere&quot; (mcluhan).  the satellite environment, mcluhan opined further, will open a virtual environment that &quot;will replicate the art of drama - it will make the whole world a stage, everyone will do their thing.&quot;  everyone&#39;s an expert and no one&#39;s an authority.  </p>

<p>and i&#39;ll see yr kim kardassian on climate change &amp; raise you a nicole kidman, for all her trouble.  -a.v.</p>

      <p>Precisely Mr V.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve never trusted electricity myself - I am suspicious of anything I cannot see.</p>

<p>Speaking of not seeing things - I not with alarum that you seem to have dispensed with capital letters, apostophes and have even been driven to amphersands.  I trust this is a technical failing of fingers or keyboard rather than some statement of new age principle.  What next phonetic spelling????</p>

<p>There is also another factor in the decline of public thinking - the flimsy aluminium foil imported from the likes of China over recent years, and the declining market share of good thick Australian made Alfoil.  I have a sneaking suspicion - most of my suspicions sneak actually - that this tinsel is totally ineffectual in keeping out those messages being beamed into the minds of our more unstable citizens by the forces of darkness.</p>

<p>Between that and the interweb, we have unleashed a demon.</p>

<p>Come on Ms Plibersek  - put Alfoil on the PBS now.</p>

<p>In my line of work, the equivalent analogy is &quot;The US Government planned and executed the 9/11 attacks&quot;.

Usually someone who has a degree in paleo-biology claiming how the Twin Towers showed signs of man-made demolition activity.</p>

      <p>It’s interesting to consider the way the media is used to polarise discussion on vaccination.  On the one hand we have the avidly pro-vaccination medical and scientific establishment, ‘the voice of reason’, on the other we have people such as Meryl Dorey and Judy Wilyman who are characterised as ‘anti-vaccination nutters’.  
<br />Whose interests does this polarisation serve?  I suggest it serves the vaccine industry very well, as it creates a climate in which it is very difficult to raise legitimate concerns about vaccination practice.  
<br />It is now taken as a given that ‘vaccination is good’, ‘vaccination is safe’, ‘you can’t have too many vaccines’.  Paul Offit, Chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases and the Director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, is famous for his flippant remark that a baby’s immune system could handle as many as 10,000 vaccines, and upping the ante by saying it was probably “closer to 100,000”.(1)
<br />It seems to me that an entirely cavalier attitude has developed towards vaccination, and as a result new vaccines continue to be added to the vaccination program with an alarming lack of transparency of the process.  For example, until very recently, details of the membership of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) were not publicly accessible on the Immunise Australia website.  (I have correspondence with the Health Minister’s office on this matter commencing in November last year.)

      <p>Further to my previous comment…  Citizens are entitled to ask well-founded questions about vaccination when it appears powerful vested interests are pressing questionable lucrative medical interventions upon healthy people.  In my opinion the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine being urged upon 12/13 girls and boys is questionable.  I am currently participating in an argument about this matter on The Conversation’s “Study should dispel HPV vaccine myths” discussion thread: <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/study-should-dispel-hpv-vaccine-myths-9914" rel="nofollow">https://theconversation.edu.au/study-should-dispel-hpv-vaccine-myths-9914</a>   Discussion has also previously taken place on an article by Ian Frazer, the co-inventor of the technology enabling the HPV vaccines, i.e. “Catch cancer? No thanks, I’d rather have a shot!”:  <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/catch-cancer-no-thanks-id-rather-have-a-shot-7568" rel="nofollow">https://theconversation.edu.au/catch-cancer-no-thanks-id-rather-have-a-shot-7568</a> </p>

      <p>&quot;It’s interesting to consider the way the media is used to polarise discussion on vaccination.&quot;</p>

<p>I think the main criticism of the media is that it doesn&#39;t polarise the discussion nearly enough.  </p>

<p>&quot;Whose interests does this polarisation serve?&quot;</p>

<p>All of us. Well at least those of us who are happy that children don&#39;t die horribly from diseases which we have the means to prevent.*</p>

<p>* See how I didn&#39;t pretend to be the &quot;voice of reason.&quot; I used an emotional appeal! For more emotional stuff check out the images of small-pox on wikipedia.</p>

      <p>&quot;Citizens are entitled to ask well-founded questions about vaccination.&quot;</p>

<p>They most certainly are. However, a problem arises due to our tendency to deny well founded science that disagrees with our particular predilictions.</p>

      <p>You raise a good point about the transparency of the approval process for vaccines.  It is important that the bona fides of people with responsibility for approving therapeutic goods be publicly demonstrated, for example.</p>

<p>Is the evidence on which their decisions are made also publicly accessible?  Surely is is even more important to be able to review the evidence rather than just knowing where the people live. </p>

<p>Double-blind, placebo controlled trials (using a true placebo - not a vaccine adjuvant, another vaccine or a vaccine solute) funded by our government which budgets hundreds of millions of dollars a year to vaccination without spending one cent on testing should be the order of the day - but it&#39;s not. </p>

<p>And a respectful and transparent debate on this subject (not the personal attacks and abuse as shown by organisations like Stop the AVN - organisations which Patrick Stokes openly participates in - so much for academic impartiality!) should be what we strive for - but there is very little evidence that those who call themselves scientists and wish to be considered the arbiters of this information care a whit for anything but defending their own biases at the expense of freedom of choice.</p>

      <p>What is &#39;independent research?&#39;</p>

<p>Can you name an organisation suitably qualified to do these studies you consistently whinge for?</p>

<p>Even if the &#39;funding&#39; comes from the Government, the very same people you claim are corrupt are *still* the experts in this area.
<br />If you believe you have the skills to conduct such studies as a lay person, why haven&#39;t you done it?</p>

<p>Scientific debate occurs in peer reviewed journals so that everyone around the world can see the evidence and with their own scientific research, conduct a study challenging those claims. That is how science works, with scientists.
<br />If you think you should be included in this debate, go get the qualifications necessary to contribute and do some work.</p>

<p>Whinging and whining that you don&#39;t like the funding/scientist/qualifications/etc is not scientific debate. Contributing to the body of knowledge through well constructed, *ethical* research IS.</p>

      <p>Meryl,
<br />until you learn what a placebo is, when it comes to drug trials, I don&#39;t think you can comment on vaccine safety trials. And I&#39;m not censoring you. I just think it helps to have a scientific discussion if one understands what the terms involved mean.</p>

      <p>Hi Elizabeth,</p>

<p>&quot;Citizens are entitled to ask well-founded questions about vaccination...&quot;</p>

<p>I agree wholeheartedly and encourage such. I question though, whether some citizens are willing to accept answers which are not in alignment with their views on the matter. I have come across many cases in which anti-vaccinationists have requested evidence for the safety and efficacy of vaccines or insights into the way phaemecutical trials work or public health decisions are made, only to ignore or dismiss it when it is presented to them. Calls to present and debate the evidence which are followed by refusals to acknowledge the evidence are tiring.</p>

<p>I would also like to note that it is important to distinguish the difference between a concerned citizen who is questioning vaccine safety and policy and an anti-vaccination advocate who promotes herself as an authority on the safety and efficacy of vaccines and believes that she is on such equal footing with experts that she should be consulted when the media covers news relating to vaccine safety, vaccine innovation and epidemics of vaccine preventable diseases.

      <p>Hi Elizabeth,</p>

<p>No, I&#39;m not - I&#39;m not familiar with you at all and I made no assumptions as to your stance, nor was I implying that you fitted any of the characters I described above. I apologise if that was not clear. </p>

<p>My point was that I wholeheartedly support enquiry, but am frustrated when I see that enquiry clouded by bias, or encounter those promoting an anti-vaccination agenda masquerading as somebody merely questioning vaccine safety and efficacy. I did not mean to imply that you were either biased or anti-vaccination and I am sorry if it came across as such.</p>

      <p>Dear Elizabeth, we have all been straight forward and clear about our beliefs and position. ONly those who are happy to play games are pretending or hiding where they stand and in such an important debate that seems reasonalbe. So no more game playing- scientists are rigorously schooled to avoid assumptions- not so the other side- please just declare yourself rather than playing peek a boo. These are all busy professional people and a tiny bit of respect for their time and effort is not unwarranted.</p>

      <p>Meryl,</p>

<p>&quot;there is very little evidence that those who call themselves scientists and wish to be considered the arbiters of this information care a whit for anything but defending their own biases at the expense of freedom of choice&quot;</p>

<p>You appear to put very little stock in what scientists do and have to say on this issue, while basically implying that no scientists, researchers, doctors or nurses care about anything other than being right. That&#39;s a pretty bold claim, a fairly black view of the human condition, and, quite frankly, incredibly insulting, not to mention hypocritical.  </p>

<p>By what method do you propose these double-blind, placebo controlled trials be carried out, if not a scientific one?</p>

      <p>Nice one, Patrick.</p>

<p>I can have whatever opinion I want, but there&#39;s no garuantee it will be respectable and not liable to merciless ridicule.  And in some kind of &quot;social regulatory&quot; way, I hope ridiculous beliefs are mercilessly ridiculed - that&#39;s how I learned when I was a youngster (mis)educated in postmodern philosophy.  I found like minded people in my classes easy to talk to, but as soon as I had to argue in the broader world I all of a sudden found people saying &quot;what you&#39;re saying gives me no good reason to believe you&quot; (at the polite end of the spectrum).  </p>

<p>And so if I actually want to have a conversation (a real one, where you are actually trying to convince someone of the truth or validity of what you&#39;re saying, and not just posturing and beating your chest), I very quickly learned that poorly reasoned, lazily argued, emotionally led argument was frustratingly ineffective with anyone who didn&#39;t already believe me anyway.  And then of course if you think you&#39;re right but no-one has any respect for what you&#39;re saying, it can often force some important re-evaluation - if you&#39;re honest, or if your beliefs aren&#39;t so tightly coupled to your sense of identity and the world - like believers in the free market religion and climate change denial.  Seems that&#39;s the best we can hope for form this kind of social regulatory approach, but there are unfortunate psychological facts mitigating against it.  I did my philosophy honour&#39;s thesis (analytical philosophy by then) on &quot;Intelligent Design&quot;.  You can bang your head against the wall reading that literature.  I have to share the best argument I ever read, from an evangelical philosophy journal though I unforunately lost the reference since the argument didn&#39;t make my paper:</p>

<p>(1)  As science progresses, it should explain more and more
<br />(2)  But as science has progressed on its current course, it is increasinly unlikely that it will explain the virgin birth
<br />(C)  Therefore, (yep, you guessed it) science is on the wrong path, we need Jesus as a scientific postulate, etc...</p>

<p>And amazing analogies to climate change denial, reading through that literature.</p>

      <p>Excellent article but we have to be careful. Who is to decide if an argument is bulldust? It is obvious in cases of vaccinations and astrology but when the issue becomes more contentious, who is to dictate which side gets to present their view? </p>

<p>I do not mind someone presenting both sides of the argument of vaccinations as long as the journalist states that there is no peer reviewed data that support their claim etc. Leaves it to the audience to make their minds up for which argument is the strongest, removing an arbiter of public debate.</p>

      <p>&quot;...who is to dictate which side gets to present their view?&#39;</p>

<p>I think Patrick&#39;s position is not so much about dictating who gets to present a view. It is about what views are deserving of our respect.</p>

<p>It is the shift to pragmatic relativism in which all opinions are &quot;equal&quot;</p>

<p>I say that Soctrate&#39;s mortality leads us to conclude that all humans are mortal. You say that Socrates humanity leads us to conclude that Socrates is mortal. </p>

<p>One is valid, the other is not. I can state my case, but I cannot claim that my case should be respected just because it is my case when it is clearly not the case.</p>

      <p>Great article. </p>

<p>I agree Joseph that we should not dictate debate but unfortunately I don&#39;t think the public and &quot;current affair&quot; shows such as Today Tonight would ever present both sides nor state that there is no scrap of peer reviewed data for one side of the debate because that wouldn&#39;t be sensational enough or draw a crowd. (Plus a lot of people wouldn&#39;t know what a peer review entails or how important real evidence is).</p>

<p>The problem with vaccination though is that there was once a debate but that was over many years ago.
<br />It&#39;s quite disconcerting that anti-vaccination groups are still active in 2012. It&#39;s equivalent to someone believing the earth is flat.</p>

<p>I work as a doctor and it pains me to see that propagating unscientific &quot;opinion&quot; by anti-vax groups is acceptable under the guise of free speech - surely they would need to work in the field or have research in the area? 
<br />Doctors support vaccination because we have seen the difference in saving lives. My grandparents were doctors in the mid to late 1900s and saw many infectious diseases which are now preventable because of vaccines, whereas us docs of today work mainly in chronic diseases.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also jolly selfish for people to refuse vaccinations for themselves or their children because the premise of vaccination is &quot;herd immunity&quot; i.e. population health and I don&#39;t think it is the right of one person to put others at risk by refusing immunisation when it is safe to do so and the evidence is unequivocal, unless it is for some exceptional reason. </p>

      <p>I think in all the hype, the fundamental argument here is whether parents have the right to choose to vaccinate, or not vaccinate, their children. And the fundamental goal of the AVN is to ensure freedom of information and freedom of choice. Somewhere along the way this has been lost.</p>

<p>Well educated, well informed, people aren&#39;t getting caught up in this politically and financially motivated lunacy surrounding the vaccination debate. They&#39;re doing their research, and making the best choices they can for themselves with the information they are able to access. Maybe the time, media, and money being wasted on these fruitless arguments could be better use to fund private research on the safety and efficacy of the present vaccine schedule. I&#39;m sure many parents would appreciate research that was funded by an entity not associated with the pharmaceutical industry.</p>

      <p>Valli Jones - the fundamental issue here is not about vaccination at all.  The AVN and Meryl Dorey only appeared in Patrick Stoke&#39;s article as an example.  The issue here is about opinions.  If Patrick had used the issue of what brand of football to use in the AFL as an example we would not be debating footballs.  As usual however, whenever the issue of vaccination is mentioned the AVN President and her minions flock to the comments to beat the anti vax drum.  It is all getting rather old and tired.</p>

      <p>&gt; the fundamental goal of the AVN is to ensure freedom of information and freedom of choice</p>

<p>Then the committee should consider whether Meryl Dorey, who spends hundreds of thousands of dollars annually in &#39;expenses&#39; whilst making the AVN look like a bunch of crazed anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists, is really effective in achieving that goal.</p>

      <p>Interesting article.</p>

<p>I think there is a very fine line between  &quot;not having your views taken seriously [and] not being allowed to hold or express those views at all&quot;</p>

<p>There is a disturbing tendency in some circles to try to silence discussion by encouraging people not to respond to particular views, rather than simply putting their reasons for disagreeing.</p>

      <p>Craig, you make an interesting point but what panics people like me is when the author of the study that all the lies are based on admits that it was FALSE and no one listens. People continue to build on that information as though it were true. The children are being injured and the parents who are desperate to understand why their child has autism put their own lives virtually on the line to defend this crazy lie someone surely must say ENOUGH. Truth must prevail. Why is no one asking what the liars are gaining?</p>

      <p>This is the thing Meryl. You do not argue with the use of science. You argue via use of pseudoscience and complete and utter misinterpretations of actual science. </p>

<p>You have no qualifications in any of the medical and science related fields, yet your hubris demands that you feel that you have a superior knowledge to those that actually have a clue as to what they are talking about. </p>

<p>Once you go out and get qualifications in immunology/virology/medicine etc, then maybe your opinion will hold some weight (and then, only if it is backed by rigorous and tested science). </p>

      <p>Science requires falsifiability, which requires reproducibility.</p>

<p>I have no great knowledge of the vaccination topic, but I do have a sense that the good outweighs the bad, mostly because I have confidence that those who have done the research have done their best to falsify their hypotheses and that their results are reproducible.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the scientific method I have confidence in, and that leads me to have confidence in the results that it produces.</p>

      <p>Again Craig, I agree with you. And I was always under the impression that those who had gone before had done their best to make sure that any evidence of dangers or ineffectiveness had been thoroughly investigated and that we would never use products on our children (or adults) which had been shown to have a benefits:risk ratio which was skewed towards the risks. Unfortunately, my research has shown that for a significant minority, the risks of vaccination far outweigh their benefits and those benefits are themselves based upon the poorest of scientific theories - that the presence of antibodies equates to immunity.</p>

<p>If antibodies don&#39;t equal immunity (and we know that they do not), then how are vaccines meant to prevent infection? I suggest that anyone who is interested in more information on this issue read the ebook - Vaccine Illusion by Harvard-trained immunologist, Tetyana Obuyhanych <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vaccine-Illusion-ebook/dp/B007AW2CLG" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Vaccine-Illusion-ebook/dp/B007AW2CLG</a>.</p>

<p>Is there reason to be concerned about whether or not vaccines do what we have been told they do? Yes, there is and that reason is found within peer-reviewed science - not subject to interpretation.</p>

<p>Is there reason to be concerned about whether or not vaccines can cause harm to a significant subset of those they are administered to? Yes, there is - and that information is found within peer-reviewed science - not subject to interpretation.</p>

<p>Is there reason to worry about those who say that only those who toe the current medical party line should be heard or be able to participate in this scientific debate? I leave it to you to answer that question.</p>

      <p>You are supposedly an expert after 20 years, yet you are asking basic fundamentals which are answered in first year immunology papers? </p>

<p>Again, you are not qualified to speak on the science, simply because you do not have the relevant education to interpret it in any way. </p>

      <p>Meryl, if I may, I have a question for you. </p>

<p>Why have you decided against undertaking any formal studies in science over the past twenty years that you have spent researching vaccine safety and efficacy? </p>

<p>I suggest that just undertaking a foundation unit through Open University would be of great value to you. SSK18, Rocket Science: Academic Skills for Science Students (<a href="http://www.open.edu.au/courses/arts/murdoch-university-rocket-science-academic-skills-for-science-students--ssk18-2012" rel="nofollow">http://www.open.edu.au/courses/arts/murdoch-university-rocket-science-academic-skills-for-science-students--ssk18-2012</a>) covers basic statistical literacy, introduces skills in critical thought including assessing bias and outlines what science is and is not. It would be a fantastic starting point for you to begin to equip yourself with the skills and understanding to assess your information and argue your case from a more credible position.</p>

      <p>If you have spent 23 years studying and researching the topic, then you have had more than enough time to get your credentials. You say the studies aren&#39;t open to interpretation, but you then proceed to claim how the conclusions of many studies are wrong, and you re-interpret them yourself. Make up your mind maybe? </p>

      <p>&quot;If antibodies don&#39;t equal immunity (and we know that they do not), then how are vaccines meant to prevent infection?&quot;</p>

<p>Ummm, Meryl - nobody has ever claimed that vaccines prevent infection. They prevent the development of disease subsequent to an infection. The difference between infection and disease is significant (have you heard of lag time?). Similarly, it is not the presence of antibodies that is said to confer immunity, but the presence of memory B cells. The difference between proteins and cells is also significant. </p>

<p>It&#39;s surprising that in 20+ years of reading around the issue, you would make these elementary mistakes. Unless, of course, you have not understood what you have read.</p>

      <p>I quite like the view that the author John Scalzi puts of the matter: you&#39;re entitled to your own opinion, but you&#39;re not entitled to your own facts.  Or in other words, if you want to put forward an opinion and have it *respected* (or use that opinion as a way of influencing others to share it) you need to be able to support your position with evidence, and to deal with evidence which opposes your opinion in a way other than by dismissing it entirely.  If you can&#39;t support your position with equivalent evidence to the opposing view, why should I respect your position?</p>

<p>I&#39;d be much more willing to deal with the anti-vaxers, the flat-earthers, the global climate change deniers, the intelligent design crowd and all these other contra-science positions if ANY of them were willing to deal with the evidence as it stands at present, particularly where that evidence points toward a contradiction of their position.  Instead, these sorts of groups show a profound tendency to want to cherry-pick the facts, dealing only with the ones which support their position, and ignoring the ones which point in opposite directions.</p>

<p>So, for example, the anti-vaccination crowd (both in the USA and here in Australia) tends to point to the increase in diagnoses of autism spectrum disorders as being evidence that vaccines are harmful[1].  Now, there&#39;s two possible reasons for the increase in diagnoses.  One of these is that there&#39;s more cases of autism around; more children are developing disorders on the autism spectrum.  The other possible reason runs like this: the base level of ASD cases is the same as it always was, and we&#39;re just getting better at *diagnosing* them.  I tend to support the latter explanation, since this explains the level of ADULT ASD diagnosis which is occurring.  It&#39;s not that there&#39;s more around, it&#39;s just that we&#39;re better at spotting what we&#39;re looking at for what it is.  </p>

<p>(My own contention is that ASD conditions have ALWAYS been with us - it&#39;s just that each generation found its own way to bull through the whole business).  </p>

<p>However, the anti-vaccination crew don&#39;t want to deal with the phenomenon of adult ASD diagnosis.  They don&#39;t want to have to deal with that fact, because it means their nice, neat, seamless explanation for the world starts to develop some holes.  In the same way, the flat-earth movement doesn&#39;t deal well with photographs from space; the intelligent design people don&#39;t cope well with the theory of evolution being able to be used as a predictive tool; climate change deniers argue endlessly that unusual weather multiple years in a row doesn&#39;t mean the climate is changing.  The people in these groups won&#39;t actually deal with evidence which doesn&#39;t go the way they want it to.</p>

<p>[1] I&#39;m not going to bother with debunking the link between ASD and vaccination.  That&#39;s been done already, and by better people than myself.  </p>

      <p>We&#39;re not all learned philosophers, or philosophy students, members of the public are entitled to their opinions because of the possibility that their opinions might indeed be correct. </p>

<p>That said, the possibility that the opinions of unqualified climate change sceptics or anti-vaccinators might be valid, is very small. &quot;To each his own trade.&quot; There&#39;s certainly no obligation to give fringe opinions publicity, I&#39;m certainly irritated when lawyers, economists and scientists with irrelevant qualifications pontificate on climate change. The real problem is not that people express looney opinions but that they are taken seriously by significant sections of the public--that&#39;s a failure of our education system.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m reading Stokes&#39;s post correctly, he would agree that members of the public are all absolutely &quot;allowed-to-say&quot;-entitled to have their opinions, full stop. (And they&#39;re &quot;entitled&quot;-entitled to have opinions, but only some of the time, depending on how well they can vouch for them.)</p>

<p>I&#39;m vaguely miffed that he&#39;s introduced two definitions for the same phrase. It makes it impossible to tell whether commenters on this article are talking at cross purposes :(</p>

      <p>this isn&#39;t about 9/11, first of all, it wasn&#39;t an &quot;inside job&quot;, squares are not circles, otherwise they&#39;d be called circles, and the only time 1+1 doesn&#39;t = 2 is when it is in binary and it equals 10, which in binary, is still 2.</p>

<p>This is a robust discussion of the kind we encourage and value at The Conversation.</p>

<p>However threats of violence, or even intimations that violence should be used, towards other commentors is in clear contravention of our community standards and will not be tolerated. Repeated breaches of the standards may see posting privileges revoked.</p>

      <p>I would love to comment extensively on this article, but due to an ongoing court case I have to be careful about what I say in public about certain matters. The court case is about my right to express an opinion which is contrary to someone else&#39;s opinion, an opinion which I think is wrong. The person taking the action against me claims to be in favour of free speech and is even on record as saying that they encourage people to disagree with them and have never tried to suppress contrary opinion.</p>

<p>As part of never suppressing contrary opinion they have banned me from at least two Internet mailing lists, blocked me from commenting on Facebook pages, blocked me from following them on Twitter, refused to allow my comments on blogs to pass moderation (even on blog articles mentioning me by name) and announced that any emails from me will be deleted unread.</p>

<p>I have promised never to do any of these things in response. People are entitled to their opinions, no matter how wrong those opinions are. They don&#39;t, however, have an automatic entitlement to be taken seriously.</p>

      <p>For everyone else here who would like to make this a debate about me personally, I will not be participating. The issue raised in this article is - do people who are critical of a belief held by the mainstream establishment have a right to express their side of the vaccination issue. I believe that they do - if they can provide evidence to back up their assertions. I can provide evidence - it&#39;s just that &#39;science&#39; as it is practised today - does not like to examine evidence contrary to currently-held dogma. </p>

<p>So perhaps the question isn&#39;t - do those who are critical of vaccination have a right to express their opinions and present their evidence in public. Instead, the question should be - are scientists mature enough to examine evidence when it is presented to them - even if that evidence flies in the face of what they believed to be true.</p>

      <p>Meryl, if you haven&#39;t noticed, this article uses the first half to destroy what it is you spout on a daily basis. This article is not only regarding the right to an opinion, it is about how you *personally* try to make opinion as valid, if not *more* valid than objective fact. </p>

<p>Cry all you want about people taking you to task for your lack of qualifications/education on the topic, thing is - this is exactly what this article is all about. </p>

<p>&quot;do people who are critical of a belief held by the mainstream establishment have a right to express their side of the vaccination issue. I believe that they do - if they can provide evidence to back up their assertions.&quot;</p>

<p>If they actually knew what they were talking about, then sure. Thing is - the vast majority of the anti vax movement don&#39;t have a clue about what they are rabbiting on about. </p>

<p>You made the claim on WIN news that vaccines (not just the usual tired argument re: MMR), *all* vaccines can cause autism. Strangely enough - there is absolutely NO evidence to back this assertion of yours. </p>

<p>&quot;I can provide evidence - it&#39;s just that &#39;science&#39; as it is practised today - does not like to examine evidence contrary to currently-held dogma.&quot;</p>

<p>Oh really? Of course it does. This is at the heart of science, testing, falsifiable evidence and testing. If one hypothesis has more evidence to back it than another, then that is where we look. </p>

<p>Thing is, I have not seen any evidence come from your circle that backs a single thing you say. You have not conducted any trials or studies yourself via use of the scientific method. You do not have any contrary evidence to supply in regards to currently accepted evidence. </p>

<p>Your whole argument rests on conspiracy theory - that the scientific &quot;elite&quot; are somehow covering up the &quot;real&quot; research and that people such as yourself are purposely being silenced by supposed vested interests. </p>

<p>This isn&#39;t the case at all. What is happening is that people are taking you to task for your ridiculous assertions, they are advising you that you are wrong, on so many levels. </p>

<p>On so, so many levels. </p>

<p>It is statements like these that make real researchers not take you seriously. 
<br />Just because you&#39;re not seeing such things played out on your turf (Google, blogs etc) doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t happening.
<br />Even in weekly staff meetings there are constant conversations about data quality, how we can challenge ideas, extend knowledge - we don&#39;t get funding unless we do this! We have to be shown to be a valuable contributor to the body of knowledge.</p>

<p>To have a person who doesn&#39;t have the qualifications or experience say that &quot;you&#39;re not doing your jobs properly&quot; - really, it is quite amusing. And when I say experience, I don&#39;t mean reading about the topic (I&#39;ve been reading cookbooks for 11 years, doesn&#39;t make me a chef) I mean experience in the field, coming up against obstacles in research and debating solutions with your peers, taking what you&#39;ve learned, publishing it, sharing it with other peers to be challenged. The process is continual.</p>

<p>You can be critical and hold a &#39;belief&#39; contrary to anything you wish to. Doesn&#39;t make it valid. </p>

<p>The &#39;evidence&#39; you claim to have is completely without context. Unless you can argue why it is valid in the context of the playing field you are trying to play on, then it will continue to be dismissed as invalid. Protip: the stuff you have, HAS been viewed in context of the playing field. That is why it was dismissed. Not because it &#39;goes against the grain&#39;

      <p>Meryl; your comment suggests you have not actually spoken to many scientists, or you decided to simply ignore the predominant findings of peer-reviewed research. I hear this nonsense about how scientists &quot;do not like to examine evidence contrary to currently-held dogma&quot; all the time on media outlets. As a scientist, I have never known a colleague to act this way. Yes, fraud and bias have rarely occurred. But you base your argument on your belief that there is resounding scientific bias. If you actually integrated yourself into the lives of scientists you would quickly learn that this is not true.</p>

      <p>Euan: I think you are presuming too much. To the best of my knowledge, we&#39;ve never met or spoken. You don&#39;t know me and therefore, you can&#39;t possibly know who I&#39;ve spoken with, what I&#39;ve studied or what knowledge I&#39;ve gained over my 23 years of research into this subject.</p>

<p>You said that my comments suggest to you that I have not actually spoken with many scientists and then, continue on to the absolutely gob-smacking statement that &quot;fraud and bias have rarely occurred&quot;. I will be kind and assume that you haven&#39;t read many medical journals in the last 20 years because if you had, you could be excused for thinking that bias and fraud had become the rule rather than the exception when it comes to issues of medical science.</p>

<p>The fact is that this article wants us all to defer to the greater knowledge and expertise of doctors who - the author claims - are the REAL experts when it comes to vaccination. But I have spoken with literally hundreds of doctors who are totally clueless on this subject - and that includes immunologists, paediatricians, rheumatologists and other specialists.</p>

<p>As opposed to the opinion of many people here and in the greater community, a degree in medicine does not give one any &#39;magical&#39; powers to determine the truth or otherwise of scientific issues. Doctors are not trained in research and in fact, that majority of their information about drugs and vaccines comes directly from the manufacturers of those same products.</p>

<p>Unless a doctor does their own research, they will never know any different. When they do take the time to independently investigate this issue, they very often change their viewpoint 180 degrees. Look at Larry Palevsky, Foad Yabak and other paediatricians who openly question vaccines. I would name some Australian experts as well, but in our &#39;free&#39; country, being named as someone who questions the safety and effectiveness of vaccination from within the medical community is professional suicide.</p>

<p>Science, when it is based on real evidence, is robust and needs no protection. Science is never above debate. Science is not the exclusive property of people who name themselves scientists and who gained their qualifications by agreeing to abide by accepted dogma without question.</p>

<p>I am absolutely entitled to my opinion and to express it with my evidence. Denying me - or anyone else - that right whilst ignoring the elephant in the room which is the huge amount of research questioning the validity of current vaccine theory - is totally unscientific and should not be supported by anyone claiming to be a scientist.</p>

<p>Again I say, if someone feels that their grasp of this issue is better than mine and their references are stronger, then debate me. Stating that debating me is pointless because you claim I have no information is self-serving at best.</p>

        <p>Meryl I have read all your comments on here and other fora in which you have posted.  You question how people can know what you have studied or to whom you have spoken.  I think that the bottom line here is that you don&#39;t have any paper qualifications.  Having a brain is simply not enough.

      <p>Meryl I have read all your comments on here and other fora in which you have posted.  You question how people can know what you have studied or to whom you have spoken.  I think that the bottom line here is that you don&#39;t have any paper qualifications.  Having a brain is simply not enough. Having read alt med websites and publications for 23 years, is not enough.  Despite what you might say to your critics, in order to have your opinion about vaccination and other health issues taken seriously, you need paper qualifications.  Such qualifications show that you have been taught, that you have learned and that your knowledge has been tested through exams and assessments.  All this happens to ensure that you know your stuff.</p>

<p>Strutting around, constantly challenging people to debate you simply makes you look ridiculous.  Put your ego to one side for a moment and think about it.  Why would a medical/scientific professional with 10 years or more tertiary qualifications and years of experience bother to debate you?  Quite simply, if they did, they would be tarnishing their credibility and at the same time lending undeserved credibility to you.  You constantly talk about challenging &quot;their&quot; data with &quot;your&quot; data.  You don&#39;t have any data.  You simply have scooped up muck from crank sites such as whale.to  And the data that you claim comes from mainstream medical journals - well that is cherry picked, misinterpreted and misunderstood by you.  Here is a classic example of how people like you in the anti vax/alt med world operate.  A homeopath who is well know to you, recently claimed on their website that they had read an article in BMJ supporting homeopathy.  Wow!  Just wow!  Really?  Well, it turns out that when this claim was checked that the article in question was actually a letter to the editor and it was written by a naturopath.  Now that is quite different to BMJ supporting homeopathy isn&#39;t it?  Now you are probably saying &quot;oh but that wasn&#39;t me - I didn&#39;t do that&quot; but the point is that you do, do it - frequently.</p>

<p>Now Meryl, I hope that you have noted that I have not discussed vaccination at all here. Not once.  The reason for that is that I don&#39;t hold any scientific or medical qualifications. None.  Also note that this is not a personal attack.  I am addressing what you have said with regards to your entitlement to have an opinion.  What I have is an opinion on your behaviour.  I think, having read hours and hours of your writing, that I am entitled to hold that opinion and I am entitled to have that opinion taken seriously.  My opinion?  You are getting an absolute hiding from all sectors of society and you think it is some conspiracy against you.  Did it ever occur to you, with so many many people disagreeing with you, that you might be wrong?  Your behaviour reminds me of a spoilt three year old child, screaming &quot;listen to me - I&#39;m right&quot; and then when others try to respond you stick your fingers in your ears and chant &quot;la la la I&#39;m not listening&quot;.  So please, Meryl, listen.  The world is trying to tell you something and you just might learn from it.</p>

<p>As opposed to the opinion of many people here and in the greater community, a degree in medicine does not give one any &#39;magical&#39; powers to determine the truth or otherwise of scientific issues. Doctors are not trained in research and in fact, that majority of their information about drugs and vaccines comes directly from the manufacturers of those same products.&quot;</p>

<p>You seem to get clinicians confused with real doctors who write the research, you know, PhDs.
<br />Instead of whinging you have &#39;spoken to the delivery people&#39;, then claim they&#39;re clueless on the subject, why don&#39;t you go to the source?
<br />Doctors (PhD) in virology (I happen to know one, but you refuse to listen to them), immunology, epidemiology etc
<br />these are the real experts, surely you know that?</p>

<p>As far as having an opinion on bias, &#39;reading&#39; journals over 20 years makes you know more of an expert on the research, writing, peer review, and publication than when you started. You&#39;re an observer.
<br />You could read music and watch someone play piano for years, until you actually sit down and play, you really can&#39;t claim superior skills, no matter how sure you are that you could play better than everyone.</p>

<p>It is this divide that makes your opinion not worthy of being taken seriously. You can comment all you want on the process, nobody is bothering to listen because you don&#39;t even attempt to get involved and broaden your knowledge to, at the very least, be equal to the basic knowledge of the other players.
<br />If you think you possess the exact same knowledge, then step up, start publishing, start attending conferences and become part of the conversation with your peers.</p>

<p>Whinging isn&#39;t a valid opinion.</p>

      <p>You claim Meryl...&quot; Doctors are not trained in research and in fact, that majority of their information about drugs and vaccines comes directly from the manufacturers of those same products.&quot;......
<br />NO
<br /> Pharmaceutical Reps are not qulaified to train Dr&#39;s in medicine.The role in  Pharmacuetical medicines, of a Representative, is the content of the PI, which is very important, the TGA indication and PBS listing. The role extends for those who work in Specialist medicine is to discuss ( not write!) peer reviewed articles on a disease state, or new information on a drug that has an approved indication.
<br />How to evaluate a patient is nothing to do with Pharma.
<br />You make this false statement regulary!

      <p>&quot;Having a brain is simply not enough. Having read alt med websites and publications for 23 years, is not enough. Despite what you might say to your critics, in order to have your opinion about vaccination and other health issues taken seriously, you need paper qualifications.&quot;</p>

<p>Although I agree with the rest, I strongly disagree with this statement.</p>

<p>As a homeschooled teenager, I developed an interest in genetics. I used to spend hours hanging out in the Health Sciences library, reading American Journal of Medical Genetics and other similar journals. I looked up stuff on PubMed and Google Scholar. I read pretty much everything I could find on rare genetic syndromes, especially chromosome disorders.</p>

<p>My only formal training in the subject comes from Biology 100. But in the area of genetics (though not other areas), I have been told by trained professionals that my understanding is as good as someone with a medical degree.</p>

<p>It is possible to be a self-taught expert. We should not judge the claims on who is making them, but on how well they match up to the facts.</p>

<p>In psychology (which is my major, and I studied this in much the same way as genetics), the predominant model of persuasion is the Elaboration Likelihood Model. They postulate two modes of processing an argument - central and peripheral. The central mode involves a reasoned, logical analysis of their statements and the corresponding facts. The peripheral mode involves deciding based on superficial features, such as the number of arguments (regardless of quality) or how &#39;official&#39; the paper looks - or the qualifications of the one writing.</p>

<p>Trained experts are still human, and they still make mistakes. Self-taught people can be quite knowledgable, if they put enough time and effort into learning. Although the probability is higher that a trained expert is correct, we must not assume that - we must look at how well the facts back up their statements.</p>

<p>In the case of the cause of autism, I can tell you by my research into the topic that autism is predominantly genetic. If you want I could cite a pile of journal articles about it. There are hundreds of candidate genes for autism, each of which likely accounts for some autistics, because autism isn&#39;t one condition, it&#39;s many. Are there some kids whose autism was caused by vaccination? Yes - I know of at least one, who had an undetected mitochondrial disorder and the fever and lack of appetite after vaccination sent her into a metabolic crisis. But these kids are a very small proportion of autistic kids. I don&#39;t need a degree to know this. I&#39;ve done my reading, medical journals instead of quack science. Many journals are free to the public, and if you live near a university, by visiting it you can find many more. Not having a degree doesn&#39;t stop you from finding stuff out.</p>

<br />Stephanie - of course it is possible to learn a great deal by reading - many interested amateurs know a lot more of the theory about their specific area of interest than professionals who are not specialists in that area.</p>

<p>There is a huge gap, however, between knowing theory on a topic and actually practising a profession or making policy decisions where you are responsible for health outcomes of real human beings.</p>

<p>A real understanding of clinical genetics means understanding all the clinical sciences - you can&#39;t understand the way the human organism functions by learning only the anatomy of the lower limb, or only the function of the renal tubules.</p>

<p>FOr example, you quote a case of a child where &quot;the fever and lack of appetite after vaccination sent her into a metabolic crisis.&quot; But did you know that a much more frequent cause of fever and lack of appetite is An infective illness - something as simple as a minor viral infection? The vast majority of simple febrile convulsions in childhood are caused by relatively minor infective illnesses. So, if the child you know had not been vaccinated, could the same reaction not have occurred when they caught any infective illness?</p>

      <p>Ms Dorey makes these proclamations while having no idea what doctors are trained in - either in medical school or during life-long ongoing education.</p>

<p>She names a couple of American paediatricians: the first is a general paediatrician who has no scientifc publications in the area of vaccination - nor in any other area.</p>

<p>Dr Fouad Yazbak (not &quot;Foad Yabak&quot;) was a co-author on papers about the impact of rubella on pregnancies in the 1960&#39;s. Accuracy is important.</p>

<p>IN the meantime, the overwhelming majority of paediatricians understand and promote the enormous benefits of vaccination, while acknowledging the small incidence of significant side-effects. </p>

      <p>The trouble is Sue, that if you happen to be the parent of a child who suffers one of those side-effects it&#39;s a pretty big deal.</p>

<p>While the incidence may be small, if it is non-zero then they have a reasonable point in saying they don&#39;t regard population health as sufficient a motivation to take that risk.</p>

<p>As I said, I don&#39;t agree, but simply reiterating the same thing won&#39;t make their point go away.</p>

      <p>Most people understand that human life involves non-zero risk, Craig.</p>

<p>Wearing seat-belts and having vehicle air-bags also entails non-zero risk, but our cooperative society has agreed that these tiny risks should be systematically borne for the much larger benefits. The risks and benefits have been studied and quantified - as they have been with vaccination.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t ignore a non-zero-risk - I live with it, as does all of humanity.</p>

      <p>I ride a motorcycle Sue and I&#39;ve had more than one incident involving serious injury. The rewards I get from riding the motorcycle are sufficient in my mind to make the risk worthwhile. I work with someone who has just sold his motorcycle because he had a slight skid in the wet and came to the conclusion that the risk was too great for the benefit he gains. He may be right, but he&#39;s not me.</p>

<p>The anti-vaxers believe that the benefits associated with vaccination are not sufficient to justify the risk they perceive as being associated with the process.</p>

<p>I agree that this is entirely subjective, but that&#39;s the way it is. For some people no amount of avoidable risk is acceptable, while for others risk is part of life.</p>

      <p>The issue remains this- Craig- that if you knowingly choose to accept the risks of riding a motorcylce- it is your skin and bone and brain tissue or those of your knowling passenger that remain like skid marks on Australia&#39;s roadways where as when you choose not to vaccinate your child- you choose danger for everyone who intersects with your child&#39;s life and they never consciously assumed that risk. </p>

<p>First, the risks and benefits of both motorcycle riding and infectious diseases are quantifiable - in objective numbers (incidence, hospitalisations, deaths etc). The risks of infectious diseases are significant, those of vaccination are tiny in comparison.</p>

<p>Second, both people who are sick with infectious diseases and those who ride motorcycles in traffic interact with the general community - their behaviour or condition impacts on others, and they use the health care system.</p>

<p>If people want to ride motorbikes on their private properties only, and never seek health care for injuries sustained, then they have the right to those choices. When those behaviours impact on others, however, the significance of the decisions changes. Even more so when one makes the decision on behalf of a minor (as in vaccination).</p>

<p>Do you hold the same views for seat-belts, drink-driving, airbags, childseats in cars? Fences on cliffs? When you ride your motorbike, do you wear a helmet? Do you stop at red lights? Many people argue that these societal requirements breach their civil liberties, but our society believes in regulation for the greater good.</p>

      <p>I couldn&#39;t agree more Sue. My point was that all that rationality doesn&#39;t matter when you&#39;re trying to convince people who hold an irrational viewpoint. By any objective rational measure riding a bike is crazy, yet I still do it, irrationally. Sure, I take the usual self-protective measures, but I know from personal experience they don&#39;t work especially well.</p>

<p>I suspect the same applies to anti-vaxers. They place high weightings on aspects of their decision-making that by any object and rational assessment are simply not justified, while they weight the risk associated with failing to vaccinate quite lightly, </p>

<p>There is another parallel with motorcycles in the helmet laws. When helmets were made compulsory in the S (that happened before my time here), there were lots of people who refused to comply on the grounds that they were worried about the helmet causing neck injury and hence some form of disabling paralysis, which wasn&#39;t completely unfounded, but the odds were low and much lower than the risk of skull fracture and other injuries without a helmet. Since then it has become even lower with new designs of helmet, but some people still refuse to comply, even today. They really hate the idea of being confined to a wheelchair so much that they&#39;d rather die.</p>

<p>The anti-vaxers hold purely a subjective perception of the nature (not the magnitude) of the risks and that&#39;s why you won&#39;t change their minds.</p>

<p>As I said earlier, it then becomes a discussion over their heads about whether it is justifiable to coerce them. I&#39;m still not entirely convinced that it is, given that the diseases in question have been with us for many, many centuries and are readily managed if a child does contract them. As a child I had all the usual illnesses, including both measles and rubella and chickenpox, although I never had mumps, despite my parents best efforts to expose me.</p>

<p>I personally think vaccination is a public good that should be encouraged, but I&#39;m not sure that it is such a great public good that it should be mandatory, or that it should be supported by coercion. It concerns me that our society is becoming ever more ready to use coercion as a first rather than last resort, but that&#39;s probably a discussion for elsewhere.</p>

      <p>I take your point, but I don&#39;t think the anti-vaxers will find it convincing. From their point of view by insisting on vaccination you are risking a great harm to their child in order to avert a small harm to someone else.</p>

      <p>Thanks Craig, this is actually helpful dialogue but here is where i am as an individual. I will work to ensure that people in general begin to understand that those who willfully choose the path of the antivaxers are antisocial, that it has astoudning consequences for society in general and for those who are exposed to these people in particular so that they will not blindly encourage such madness. There is a huge difference between informed concent and playing along and it is beginning to cost innocent and formerly uninformed lives.</p>

      <p>Patrick, The Conversation’s comments thread on “Measles outbreak calls for vaccination vigilance” was arbitrarily shut down today, preventing me from responding to Sue Ieraci’s query about my definition of “paternalistic experts”: <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/measles-outbreak-calls-for-vaccination-vigilance-10042" rel="nofollow">https://theconversation.edu.au/measles-outbreak-calls-for-vaccination-vigilance-10042</a> 
<br />As my response is pertinent to the Mediawatch story on a measles outbreak mentioned in your article, and provides a practical example of what you call “a policy response to science”, I will post it here, on the “No, you’re not entitled to your opinion” thread.
<br />So, on the subject of ‘paternalism’…or the tyranny of ‘experts’…
<br />In the “measles outbreak” article linked to above, Peter McIntyre, (who is an ex officio member of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation [ATAGI], and I assume in a position to contribute to discussion on vaccination policy), is quoted as saying:  “To start primary school in the US if you don’t have your paperwork showing two measles shots they say “sorry, come back when you have the paperwork,”…That might be seen as a bit tough…but on the other hand it does really work.”  
<br />It appears Professor McIntyre believes that “parents should be required to show proof their children have been immunised against measles before they are allowed to start school”, i.e. compulsory vaccination with two MMR live vaccines.
<br />Yet, according to various sources, most children are likely to develop immunity to measles after the first MMR live vaccine.
<br />For example:
<br />-	the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises: “Measles antibodies develop among approximately 95% of children vaccinated at age 12 months and 98% of children vaccinated at age 15 months (CDC, unpublished data)…Although vaccination produces lower antibody levels than natural disease, both serologic and epidemiologic evidence indicate that the vaccine induces long-term – probably lifelong – immunity, in most persons.”(1)
<br />-	the Product Information sheet for GlaxoSmithKline’s PRIORIX measles/mumps/rubella live vaccine sold in Australia states, “in previously seronegative vaccinees, antibodies were detected in 98.0%, 96.1% and 99.3% of subjects against measles, mumps and rubella respectively”;(2)
<br />-	the Cochrane Collaboration’s systematic review of MMR vaccination reports that “based on the available evidence, one MMR vaccine dose is at least 95% effective in preventing clinical measles and 92% effective in preventing secondary cases among household contacts”.(3) 
<br />Patrick, in your response to Meryl Dorey you said: “Now, here’s where you and I *are* entitled to have opinions, and to have those opinions taken seriously: we’re citizens, and as such policy responses to science are very much our business.”
<br />I forwarded a letter to the Federal Health Minister, Tanya Plibersek, querying the Australian government’s demand for arbitrary revaccination with two MMR live vaccines to obtain tax benefits: <a href="http://users.on.net/~peter.hart/Letter_to_Minister_Plibersek_re_MMR_vaccine.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://users.on.net/~peter.hart/Letter_to_Minister_Plibersek_re_MMR_vaccine.pdf</a> 
<br />Minister Plibersek’s office has refused to respond to my letter.
<br />(My letter was also copied to Professor Terry Nolan, Chair of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation [ATAGI].  Until recently, membership of ATAGI was not publicly known. I have correspondence with the Minister’s department enquiring about membership of ATAGI commencing in November 2011.)
<br />Patrick, some questions for you:
<br />1.	Is it acceptable that parents of young children are not informed of the reportedly high response rate to the first MMR live vaccine, and arbitrarily ordered to have a second MMR vaccine for their children?
<br />2.	Is it acceptable that the Australian government demands that, to qualify for the Family Tax Benefit Part A Supplement, children must have two MMR live vaccine doses, regardless of whether they are already immune after the first MMR vaccine? 
<br />3.	Is it acceptable that parents are not advised of the availability of serological testing to verify a response to MMR live vaccination (i.e. evidence based medicine)?
<br />4.	Is it acceptable for people/parents of children to be denied the opportunity to give their ‘informed consent’ to preventive health interventions, and other medical interventions?
<br />5.	Is Peter McIntyre entitled to demand that every child have two MMR live vaccines?
<br />6.	Do you think Minister Plibersek has a duty to respond to my detailed argument?  
<br />I would appreciate your response.
<br />Thanks
<br />Elizabeth Hart

      <p>Hi Elizabeth,</p>

<p>I think the answer to your questions would largely depend on the relative costs, coverage, and safety of one-dose vs. two-dose vaccination schedules. I&#39;m not in a position to assess those factors, so can&#39;t really comment further. However I note Candice Harris&#39; comments about coverage above.</p>

<p>Thanks,
<br />Patrick</p>

      <p>This is fascinating. Are you aware that the world is or might be observing? To diminish someone in this manner is way beyond the normal rules of discourse but some of you seem to feel that personal attacks are warranted and as long as you do not generally stand behind them or suggest that the other is a blood sucking entity who refuses to lie down when dead- it is all OK. </p>

<p>Man, this is normally exciting but I hope you wait while I put my boots on!</p>

      <p>Elizabeth, am I correct in surmising that you have no tertiary degrees in immunology?  If I have read Patrick correctly, I think he is saying that without the appropriate qualifications and experience, people who pose as experts are not entitled to have their opinions respected.</p>

<p>&quot;Elizabeth is a Research Officer, with a degree majoring in
<br />politics and philosophy. This background has assisted her in
<br />researching and lobbying on this subject. The ethical aspects
<br />are of particular interest to her.
<br />She is working with other concerned pet owners, Bea Mies
<br />and Pat Styles, who have also been campaigning on this issue
<br />since they strongly suspect their dogs were also adversely
<br />affected by unnecessary vaccination.&quot;</p>

      <p>Thank you Patrick - seems Elizabeth is only concerned about her own say and not reading the comments people put in reply to it. So I&#39;ll quote myself here for Elizabeth&#39;s benefit.</p>

<p>There are some things in health policy that are about the bigger picture Elizabeth.</p>

<p>&quot;</p>

<p>Elizabeth, if it is your opinion that the NIP &#39;arbitrarily&#39; has two doses of MMR in the schedule - do you honestly think the addition of a second dose to the schedule (at incredible cost and resource cost) *hasn&#39;t* been thoroughly debated by the subject matter experts?</p>

<p>On a slightly different note, you claim in your letter that the emphasis should be on getting everyone vaccinated with one dose.
<br />Surely you understand the basic logistics of getting *every* child in Australia vaccinated with only one-dose on the schedule is pretty darn hard to do - combine that with the one-dose 5% failure to confer immunity and the vaccination coverage for one-dose on the schedule for MMR in Australia would be well below what is needed for herd immunity.</p>

<p>Adding a second dose to the schedule *is* maximising one-dose MMR coverage, it&#39;s ensuring the most opportunity for children to get at LEAST one-dose.&quot;</p>

<p>In other words, the addition of another vaccine to the schedule is incredibly expensive for the government to fund and administer. THAT is how serious they take measles in this country. They don&#39;t cross their fingers and dilly dally with one-dose on the schedule. When you combine the percentage vaccinated at 12months with MMR and then consider another 5% of those will not get immunity from the vaccine. We are dropping below herd immunity numbers.</p>

<p>What else is taken into consideration is the R0 this is the reproduction rate of the disease (ie how many people ONE case would infect) in the case of measles it is 12-18. to put that in perspective influenza is 2-3. 
<br />There are so many more factors taken into consideration such as complications from the disease, economic cost etc etc. </p>

<p>Your &#39;opinion&#39; isn&#39;t taken seriously because you haven&#39;t even scratched the surface of what a decision like this entails. To write a letter to that effect, stomping your feet just clearly shows how little you know. </p>

<p>now I have given you a really really basic heads up of what goes into making these types of decisions (and I mean REALLY basic) and so you know these are not my &#39;opinions&#39; this is what I learned in my Master of Public Health. 
<br />To fully inform you of the entire process, you&#39;d at minimum have the same qualification as me by the end of it!

      <p>I apologise if I am complicit in letting the topic stray into the MMR debate, but I have a question about MMR. Some of the criticism of MMR is because the triple vaccine is a &quot;triple whammy&quot; and so it may have a greater impact on infants than would three separated vaccinations. Is there a medical reason why separate vaccinations are not routinely available? I may be wrong, but I get the impression that many people who oppose MMR are not opposed to all or even most vaccinations, just this one particular &quot;king hit&quot;.</p>

<p>There is a second issue: some parents would like to see their children tested and shown to be healthy enough to withstand the special impact of each vaccine before it&#39;s administered. I don&#39;t want to get into the medical arguments here, but I mention it because I want to point out that people opposed to MMR are not all dogmatic anti-vaccination zealots.</p>

<br />there will always be *some* reason why people who oppose vaccination will have issue with any vaccine.

<br />These developments and approvals are NOT taken lightly. The better question would be &#39;why are the vaccines combined? what is the benefit?&#39;</p>

<p>The second issue of testing. To date no antivaxxer has suggested what to actually test for?
<br />How do you &#39;test health?&#39;
<br />Is it merely the absence of disease?</p>

<p>My OPINION on the matter is that parents, and mothers especially, (and I am a single mother so don&#39;t think i&#39;m speaking out of turn) have this drive to be in control of everything. I believe there is some odd cultural shift with women who are now in the workplace as dominant forces, having to apply their natural &#39;control&#39; to parenting and believe they can apply the same logic they use in their jobs to fields WELL outside their expertise, *just* because it is involving their child. Somehow giving them some pseudo expertise on the matter. </p>

      <p>Thank you Ken for this clarification. I think it is a basic tenet in most disciplines that one CANNOT generalize from animals to human beings. If you are an expert in D|OGS I think you are probably needed in that field.</p>

      <p>OK, I&#39;ll try your &quot;better question&quot; (though I am not sure it is a better question).</p>

<p>What is the benefit in combining these particular three vaccines? Is the benefit medical (for the child), epidemiological (for the population as a whole) or logistical (for the delivery agency)? Or is there some other benefit?</p>

<p>It is not true that &quot;no anti vaxxer has suggested what to actually test for&quot;. I am not an anti vaxxer, yet I can suggest appropriate tests. But to go into that issue here would be straying too far from Patrick Stokes&#39; article.</p>

      <p>3 points to Keith for that astute observation, however what happens in other species is NOT exactly what happens in humans and while we can gain cues from that research we have to do human research and rely on human research to reach any conclusions. Human beings have proven to be diverse enough as recent DNA studies and calamities like the Vioxx drug have proven. </p>

<p>You can suggest appropriate tests to measure &#39;health enough for vaccination&#39; I&#39;d be hoping you have evidence to back up why those tests are appropriate for such a purpose?
<br />Not only that but be ably to quantify why such a test would be necessary and economically viable?
<br />Taking into consideration the lag between testing, results and subsequent vaccination as a potential exposure for disease transmission? the economic cost to the parent for the extra Doctors appointment? ummm pathology cost for the test?  Cost-benefit ratio for what you are going to actually find? (ie are all these costs worth avoiding...what?)</p>

<p>But sure. Educate us all on what tests we can all get to *ensure* we will not get anaphylaxis from a vaccination.
<br />I&#39;m genunitely interested on your expert input on this matter... your expertise are in what exactly?</p>

      <p>I&#39;ll be careful with this reply as I don&#39;t want to tread further on Patrick&#39;s patience or The Conversation&#39;s generosity.</p>

<p>I did not say I knew what tests would ensure we will not get anaphylaxis from vaccination. All I said was I could suggest appropriate tests. And I meant - but did not say, sorry - that, surely, such tests would be prudent, understood in the context of patient history, as a means of identifying children who were at greater or lesser risk of suffering ill effects from vaccination at a particular time.</p>

<p>I think we come nicely now back to Patrick&#39;s point which is not about MMR or even vaccination. It&#39;s about whose interventions are worthy of consideration in a serious public debate with real consequences in the real world, and not about who wins a debate.</p>

<p>Overshadowing all this is the public controversy about climate change and its many subsidiary controversies (carbon tax, renewable energy, whether climate change is due to human activity - and which activity - the health impacts of wind power, the rights of irrigators, bushfire management, even immigration and population growth etc.). This issue is far more important than vaccination for the future of human civilization itself.</p>

<p>Even the controversy about climate change has itself been infected with and largely shaped by another controversy imported from the USA about the role of government, with those who want to take decisive action to reduce the human impact on climate being branded as socialists, interferers or aligned with &#39;one-world-order&#39; proponents who seek to undermine the US Constitution and the most cherished amendments. On the other side, those who reject government action catch a ride on any skeptic argument going, expediently acting as if the ends justifies the means. The science - to the dismay of scientists - has taken a back seat.</p>

<p>Both sides in these major controversies can be seen attempting to frame the questions to suit their own expertise and to focus the debate on areas where they have most likelihood of &quot;winning&quot; (in their eyes). We can see this happening above (not you Candice) and we see it in what&#39;s left of newspaper letters to the editor. How many people posting above are saying something like &quot;thank you for alerting me to this - I had not thought of it this way before - I am pleased to say I have changed my mind&quot;? And how many people have resorted to &#39;straw man&#39; arguments and other rhetorical devices to score a debating point - when, as many have both said and implied above - winning a point is to miss the point of the discussion.</p>

      <p>Ms Hart - since this thread is still open, and you apparently wanted to answer my question (though didn&#39;t do so before), I&#39;ll re-post it for you here:</p>

<p>&quot;Elizabeth Hart, when you refer to &quot;paternalistic &#39;experts&#39; &quot;, do you mean immunologists, padiatricians, infectious diseases experts, epidemiologists, early chidlhood nurses, or NICU nurses and doctors?</p>

<p>All these people research and promote vaccination. Which of them do you find &quot;paternalistic&quot; or not to hold expertise?&quot;</p>

      <p>Keith Thomas - vaccine policy is a combination of immunology and public health practice. The reasons for the timing of the various vaccines include:
<br />- Age at which the child is able to mount an effective immune response
<br />- Age at which the condition being vaccinated for is most prevalent
<br />- Age at which the child is most exposed to other children (eg pre-school)</p>

<p>Most anti-vaccinationists are less concerned about the antigens in the vaccines so much as the fluid they are carried in and the preservatives (although all these have been found to be safe). Combining vaccines reduces the number and volume if the injections and the load of diluent and preservative.</p>

<p>ALthough I can understand why people might ask these questions, I find it hard to understand when they don&#39;t accept the answers. IN the extreme case, Neonatal ICU nurses and doctors, who look aft er the most vulnerable micro-premmies, promote the vaccination schedule, why would the rest of us disagree? These people know a newborn&#39;s immune system intimately, and dedicate their lives to the welfare of babies. How would it make sense that they are part of some world-wide conspiracy, or just have a blind spot in this area.</p>

<p>Ms Hart and Mr Beattie like to use the term &#39;experts&#39;. For NICU nurses and doctors, I prefer the term experts.</p>

        <p>Mr Thomas - on what basis would you choose tests to be &quot;healthy enough to withstand the special impact of each vaccine before it&#39;s administered.&quot;?</p>

<p>Do you mean whether they have a normal immune system and are therefore able to mount an immune response, or do you mean whether they might have an egg allergy and react to some components of some vaccines? If they are not &quot;healthy&quot;, don&#39;t they need immunisation all the more, as they might not be able to withstand the actual infections?</p>

<p>I wonder why…</p>

      <p>Mr Thomas - on what basis would you choose tests to be &quot;healthy enough to withstand the special impact of each vaccine before it&#39;s administered.&quot;?</p>

<p>Do you mean whether they have a normal immune system and are therefore able to mount an immune response, or do you mean whether they might have an egg allergy and react to some components of some vaccines? If they are not &quot;healthy&quot;, don&#39;t they need immunisation all the more, as they might not be able to withstand the actual infections?</p>

<p>I wonder why you imagine that there has not been supremely detailed consideration of all these factors when vaccine policy is made? I fyou have not been part of a process of developing, for example, a clinical guideline, you might not appreciate the degree of detail and expertise that goes into clinical policy. Not only does it have to be rationally argued, but it also has to be visibly backed up by evidence, and regularly reviewed. I don&#39;t know what work you did before retirement, but do you imagine that someone untrained in the area could have done it better than you?</p>

<p>You say &quot;Both sides in these major controversies can be seen attempting to frame the questions to suit their own expertise and to focus the debate on areas where they have most likelihood of &quot;winning&quot; (in their eyes).&quot;</p>

<p>In my personal case, I frame my comments from my personal area of training and expertise. You will not see me questioning the evidence in climate science, or economics, or political strategy - I am neither trained in those disciplines, nor experienced in practising those professions.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the anti-vaccine posters here wish to argue on the basis of their lay opinions, without having been health care providers, or even trained in the clinical sciences.</p>

<p>Of course one can ask questions, but when the answers repeatedly go against what your originally thought, it&#39;s time to ask different ones. The questions about vaccine efficacy and safety posed by Ms Dorey, Mr Beattie and colleagues have not been ignored. On the contrary - they have been refuted with evidence over and over.</p>

<br />1.	Is it acceptable that parents of young children are not informed of the reportedly high response rate to the first MMR live vaccine, and arbitrarily ordered to have a second MMR vaccine for their children? 
<br />2.	Is it acceptable that the Australian government demands that, to qualify for the Family Tax Benefit Part A Supplement, children must have two MMR live vaccine doses, regardless of whether they are already immune after the first MMR vaccine?  
<br />3.	Is it acceptable that parents are not advised of the availability of serological testing to verify a response to MMR live vaccination (i.e. evidence based medicine)? 
<br />4.	Is it acceptable for people/parents of children to be denied the opportunity to give their ‘informed consent’ to preventive health interventions, and other medical interventions? 
<br />5.	Is Peter McIntyre entitled to demand that every child have two MMR live vaccines? 
<br />6.	Do you think Minister Plibersek has a duty to respond to my detailed argument: <a href="http://users.on.net/~peter.hart/Letter_to_Minister_Plibersek_re_MMR_vaccine.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://users.on.net/~peter.hart/Letter_to_Minister_Plibersek_re_MMR_vaccine.pdf</a> ?

      <p>&quot;I apologise if I am complicit in letting the topic stray into the MMR debate, but I have a question about MMR. Some of the criticism of MMR is because the triple vaccine is a &quot;triple whammy&quot; and so it may have a greater impact on infants than would three separated vaccinations. Is there a medical reason why separate vaccinations are not routinely available? I may be wrong, but I get the impression that many people who oppose MMR are not opposed to all or even most vaccinations, just this one particular &quot;king hit&quot;.&quot;</p>

<p>I am not an expert in immunology, but from what I understand, the reason why they give all three together is to have earlier immunity. If you gave them separately, the kid would spend several more months susceptible to one or two of the trio of illnesses that vaccine defends against.</p>

<p>Unless you&#39;re proposing just having separate injections for each, which would accomplish nothing apart from giving the kid a bit more pain.</p>

<p>We&#39;re not special. Every species has its unique quirks. Good use of animal models involves testing multiple species, and especially ones similar to us in the relevant mechanisms (for example, pigs are best for studying digestive issues, because their digestion is a lot like ours) in the hopes that if the medication has adverse effects on humans, we&#39;ll see similar effects in another species as well. It&#39;s not always perfect, but the alternatives are either to test it first on humans, risking ill effects for the human subjects, or else forego potentially beneficial treatments because we don&#39;t know if they&#39;re safe.</p>

      <p>Patrick, as intimated earlier, I was astonished by your offhand reply to my comment about unnecessary vaccination with the MMR second dose, and the lack of response to my letter to Health Minister Tanya Plibersek.  It was obvious from the speed of your reply that you gave barely any thought to my detailed and referenced comment.
<br />Please note there is an important principle at stake here.  We are in very dangerous territory when &#39;experts&#39; and governments demand that citizens/children have questionable medical interventions.
<br />In this regard, I am interested to examine the process to add vaccines to the National Immunisation Program Schedule.  There appear to be serious problems with transparency and accountability.  For instance, until recently, membership details of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) were not publicly accessible.
<br />Looking at vaccines individually, I am dubious about HPV vaccination, which has been uncritically promoted on The Conversation website, see for example Ian Frazer&#39;s article &quot;Catch cancer? No thanks, I&#39;d rather get a shot&quot;: <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/catch-cancer-no-thanks-id-rather-have-a-shot-7568" rel="nofollow">https://theconversation.edu.au/catch-cancer-no-thanks-id-rather-have-a-shot-7568</a> and Charis Palmer&#39;s article &quot;Study should dispel vaccine myths&quot;: <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/study-should-dispel-hpv-vaccine-myths-9914" rel="nofollow">https://theconversation.edu.au/study-should-dispel-hpv-vaccine-myths-9914</a>   (Critical analysis is being provided by contributors to the discussion threads on these articles.)
<br />I question how the HPV vaccine got onto the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.  In this regard, refer to my open letter to the Editor-in-Chief of The Australian, Chris Mitchell, i.e. &quot;Is universal HPV vaccination necessary&quot;: <a href="http://users.on.net/~peter.hart/Is_universal_HPV_vaccination_necessary.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://users.on.net/~peter.hart/Is_universal_HPV_vaccination_necessary.pdf</a>
<br />Patrick, vaccination is a serious and complex topic.  Polarised discussion on this subject is hindering the airing of legitimate concerns about vaccination practice.

<p>I apologise if I came across as abrupt in my earlier response. It certainly wasn&#39;t my intention to offend. However, as indicated, all the questions you raised ultimately turn on matters on which I, not being a scientist working in the relevant area, can’t really comment on.

      <p>Hi Elizabeth,</p>

<p>I apologise if I came across as abrupt in my earlier response. It certainly wasn&#39;t my intention to offend. However, as indicated, all the questions you raised ultimately turn on matters on which I, not being a scientist working in the relevant area, can’t really comment on. As I say, the answers to your questions would depend on the relative costs and benefits of one-dose vs. two-dose schedules. I don’t know what those costs/benefits are (obviously that’s a technical question well outside my scope of expertise). That leaves me with two options: I can (politely, I hope) decline to answer the question, or I can give you an answer that, by definition, would be next to worthless. In my view, the former is the more ethical and indeed more courteous approach, and so that’s what I chose.</p>

<p>You say that “We are in very dangerous territory when &#39;experts&#39; and governments demand that citizens/children have questionable medical interventions.” The scare quotes around the word expert are telling, but let’s leave that to one side. The question is: on what basis do you say these are questionable? Is this a scientific claim or a policy claim? In your letter to The Australian, for instance, you provide some fairly vague assertions about “queries re the long-term efficacy of the vaccine” and “inadequately researched possible adverse reactions to vaccination” but the only bit of peer-reviewed research you cite would appear to be a paper questioning whether HPV vaccination is an appropriate health spending priority for India given the cost and the relatively low incidence of cervical cancer there. That’s  a question about resource allocation, not about the efficacy of the vaccine itself. Hence it’s unclear whether your concern is a scientific one – in which case you need scientific training in order to make your case – or a policy one. </p>

<p>Let’s assume your concern is with the policy aspects. If your point is that below a certain incidence and lethality of a disease we should avoid preventative interventions because there’s always the risk that there will be unexpected consequences down the track, you need to articulate the point at which such a theoretical risk outweighs the reduction in the incidence of the disease. (In this case, you put a lot of weight on the fact the immune system usually clears HPV without it developing into cervical cancer, but you then seem to downplay the seriousness of the disease when it does occur). If your claim is that the money spent on HPV vaccination could be better spent elsewhere, that might also be a valid claim given other priorities, but again you need to make your case. Either way you face having to answer a pretty grim question: what number of preventable cervical cancer deaths should we tolerate, given the other claims on our resources? That may sound like a rhetorical question, but it’s not. We have finite resources and policy makers often have to make decisions that implicitly accept a certain number of deaths. So it’s a valid question, but to make a case for taking HPV vaccines off the PBS you would, I think, need to do a lot more.</p>

<p>You also make the point that vaccines make a lot of money for those who make them. I think there are serious questions about the way healthcare and medical imperatives intersect, but is the sheer fact that making vaccines is profitable evidence that they don’t work? Wouldn’t the very opposite be, at least, no less likely to be the case? </p>

<p>We agree that this is a serious and complex topic and one that raises serious policy questions, and that it calls for civility and level heads. I&#39;d submit the discussion surrounding this topic isn&#39;t helped by people making unfounded scientific assertions without being properly equipped to do so, nor by the disparagement of expertise, not to mention the constant impugning of the motives of experts and professionals working in the field.</p>

<p>Best wishes,
<br />Patrick</p>

      <p>Ken, I don’t claim to be an expert in anything…least of all immunology, that’s why I’m careful to cite references to support the arguments I make in my documents and comments.
<br />As you have discovered, my interest in vaccination was initiated after my eight year old dog Sasha became inexplicably ill, and was put down after an (unnecessary) vaccination.  I subsequently discovered that veterinarians in Australia were ignoring international dog and cat vaccination guidelines that recommended reducing vaccination to minimise the risk of adverse reactions to vaccine products.  Many veterinarians were abusing the trust of their clients by insisting on unnecessary medical interventions for their pets, and failing to obtain ‘informed consent’ for these interventions.
<br />I have been researching and lobbying on this subject for the past four years, along with my friend and colleague Bea Mies.  We have both had extensive correspondence with the Australian Veterinary Association (AVA), the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority (APVMA), the World Small Animal Veterinary Association’s Vaccination Guidelines Group, the UK Veterinary Medicines Directorate, the US Center for Veterinary Biologics, international veterinary associations, veterinary boards, academics etc.  We have attended meetings with representatives of the AVA and APVMA, and were invited to comment on the APVMA’s draft Position Statement on Vaccination Protocols for Dogs and Cats: <a href="http://www.apvma.gov.au/use_safely/vaccination.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.apvma.gov.au/use_safely/vaccination.php</a> 
<br />A summary of the Australian campaign for ethical and evidence-based vaccination of companion animals provides more background: <a href="http://users.on.net/~peter.hart/Australian_campaign_for_ethical__pet_vax.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://users.on.net/~peter.hart/Australian_campaign_for_ethical__pet_vax.pdf</a> 
<br />Here also is a link to a list of documents I have produced on this subject – articles, open letters, submissions etc: <a href="http://users.on.net/~peter.hart/Papers_articles_open_letters_re_pet_vax_E_Hart.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://users.on.net/~peter.hart/Papers_articles_open_letters_re_pet_vax_E_Hart.pdf</a> 
<br />Consumer watchdog CHOICE reported on over-vaccination of pets in 2010, i.e. “Pet vaccination – over-vaccinating your pet could be harmful to their health as well as your own hip pocket”: <a href="http://www.choice.com.au/reviews-and-tests/household/backyard/pets/pet-vaccination/page.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.choice.com.au/reviews-and-tests/household/backyard/pets/pet-vaccination/page.aspx</a> 
<br />At the risk of appearing immodest, it was largely due to the persistent efforts of Bea Mies and myself that action was taken on this matter.  Certainly the veterinary profession in Australia, the so-called ‘experts’, were reluctant to lead due to a conflict of interest, i.e. loss of practice income.  
<br />While there has been some improvement in the situation with a slow move to (unnecessary) ‘triennial vaccination’, and some action on updating vaccine product labels, many animals continue to be over-vaccinated.
<br />I suggest that pet vaccination is also relevant to human vaccination.  It is interesting that while there have been calls in veterinary medicine to “reduce the ‘vaccine load’ on individual animals in order to minimize the potential for adverse reactions to vaccine products”(1), vaccination of humans, (children, adolescents and adults), is increasing at an alarming rate.  I question the need for some of the vaccines on the schedule (e.g. the second MMR dose, and HPV vaccination).  
<br />There is a lack of transparency and accountability regarding vaccination practice in Australia and critical analysis is well overdue.

      <p>Elizabeth, please do not think that people do not respect your experience. IT IS THE UNWARRANTED GENERALIZATION OF IT THAT WE FEAR AND FIGHT.</p>

<p>Your experience is compelling- for you-a one off that you seem to fear for the general population. Let me give you a hypothetical equivalent.</p>

<p>Last December I went in for a benign tumour in my spine. I had my friend drop me off at the front door in perfect health (besides that annoying tumour that threatened my lower half) and the surgeon told me the only risk was infection and as I was at a major hospital with a sterling reputation and as it was one of my own accounts -with one of the lowest infection rates anywhere- I felt good to go. So good in fact, that I walked in alone, and took only one change of clothing and 4 books as I expected to be out in 3 days- fixed. The surgoen was throughly vetted and i discovered has a good record. </p>

<p>Well almost 6 months later I left a rehab hospital after a coma and learning to walk and talk again. The surgery went wrong.</p>

<p>i DO NOT TELL OTHER PEOPLE NOT TO HAVE SURGERY FOR TUMOURS IN THEIR SPINE-for I would consider that irresponsible.</p>

<p>In science your situation is serious, and lamentable but it has no generalizable value other than a clue of what to watch out for. It would be called a case study and we are all taught to be VERY careful with what we think we learn from them&gt;</p>

<p>I would suggest that all you might have learned just as I did -is that one practioner can be a bozo.</p>

      <p>Patrick, re your flourishing of the ‘peer-reviewed research’ card…

<br />A quote: “Increasingly, peer review has been turned into a quasi-holy institution, which apparently signifies that a certain claim is legitimate or sacred. And from this perspective, voices which lack the authority of peer review are, by definition, illegitimate. Peer review provides a warrant to be heard – those who speak without this warrant deserve only our scorn.”
<br />Here’s another quote that nicely sums up some of the attitudes on this forum: “You can almost visualise peer-review dogmatists waving their warrant and demanding that their opponents be silenced.”
<br />Other articles also provide another perspective on the often industry-funded ‘peer-reviewed research’, e.g.:

Is it a perfect system? Of course not. (Says the guy who&#39;s revising two papers for resubmission at the moment...). Is it open to corruption? Potentially, though frankly if the researchers who review papers are corrupt they&#39;re not very good at it, given how modest their incomes appear to be. But if you don&#39;t accept the authority of peer review, what better form of quality control do you recommend?</p>

<p>All academic disciplines need a method to screen out data that doesn&#39;t meet the appropriate evidentiary and/or argumentative standards. Double-blind peer review, though far from perfect, is the best we&#39;ve come up with to date. Again, if you have an alternative, I&#39;m all ears. (It would be nice if &#39;everyone just publishes everything and we all make our own minds up&#39; was an alternative. Unfortunately it simply isn&#39;t. As a researcher I don&#39;t have years to wade through material that should never have been published in order to find the credible stuff. Without the quality control provided by peer review we simply could never get started).</p>

      <p>As a self-described &quot;research officer&quot;, I&#39;m surprised Elizabeth Hart doesn&#39;t understand the dynamics and significance of &quot;peer-review&quot; a bit better.</p>

<p>The purpose of placing research into the public domain is for an informed audience to critique the methodology and assess whether the conclusions made by the authors bear any merit. The peer review that occurs before publication is only a way of checking whether that paper appears to be suitable for publication in that particular journal. It has to reach a threshhold level of quality -in structure, methodology, language, presentation of data etc. Publication does not &quot;validate&quot; the findings - far from it. If all published research were totally valid and without fault, the letters pages would not be filled with debate and critique.</p>

<p>When journals were only on paper and people either subscribed or went to libraries, the readership was an informed one - people read the material within their professional areas, knowing the other research and understanding the principles behind the practice (whether this was engineering, arboriculture, immunology or paediatrics).</p>

<p>Now, anyone can find a huge variety of internet-accessed papers, generally without accessing the full papers, and without needing to have any knowledge or understanding of that field.</p>

<p>Have you produced any published output, Elizabeth? IF so, how do you think it should be handled and communicated to the world?</p>

<p>It is correct to report and consider information about potential biases in research - the majority of which are methodological and not intentional. These are generally discussed under &quot;Study Limitations&quot;. They don&#39;t negate the study&#39;s findings - but declarations of potential bias should serve to make the reader&#39;s critique all the more sophisticated.</p>

      <p>Elizabeth - I haven&#39;t found any answer to my previous question in any of your posts, so I&#39;ll post it for you again here:</p>

<p>&quot;&quot;Elizabeth Hart, when you refer to &quot;paternalistic &#39;experts&#39; &quot;, do you mean immunologists, padiatricians, infectious diseases experts, epidemiologists, early chidlhood nurses, or NICU nurses and doctors?</p>

<p>All these people research and promote vaccination. Which of them do you find &quot;paternalistic&quot; or not to hold expertise?&quot;

Well, according to the editor of Energy &amp; Environment, it is a peer-reviewed journal - one of the biggest anti-warming journals in the world actually - but not all of it is peer reviewed.  Folks of &quot;like minds&quot; can get a paper pubished in the short article section without even basic sub-editing let alone peer review apparently.</p>

<p>Or the weird but widely quoted journal on climate published by a retired agronomist and his sons in some rustic corner of middle America.  Can&#39;t remember his name - it&#39;ll appear at 2.30am.  When one submits an article for publication here one is prompted to provide the names and contact details of three of these very peers who you&#39;d like to review your article.  Now that must cut down the paperwork, not to mention the revisions.</p>

<p>Like everything Ms Sue ... it&#39;s buried in these damn satanic details. </p>

      <p>&quot;I did not say I knew what tests would ensure we will not get anaphylaxis from vaccination. All I said was I could suggest appropriate tests. And I meant - but did not say, sorry - that, surely, such tests would be prudent, understood in the context of patient history, as a means of identifying children who were at greater or lesser risk of suffering ill effects from vaccination at a particular time.&quot;</p>

<p>But Mr Thomas - it is the hypersensitivity reactions (such as to egg protein) that are easy to test for. What other tests for what other &quot;ill effects&quot; did you have in mind?</p>

      <p>Don&#39;t confuse a good argument for truth.  A good argument is useful for being more effective.  But, winning an argument only loosely correlates with knowing the truth.  Whenever I&#39;m arguing with someone, I (try to) consider that they may be right - even if they don&#39;t know _why_ they are right.</p>

      <p>Is this the crux of the argument from that side? PLEASE.</p>

<p>Scientist are not likely to want to and no ethics committee will approve an experiment that knowingly allows people to die (exept in rare drug trial where the people are already in end stage and know it and choose to make their end count for others).</p>

<p>Scientists appear to have a very high regard for LIFE and this is the crux of the provaccination side.</p>

      <p>Hi Patrick, when I first read this piece a few days ago comments were disabled and I see they are back on now. At the time I was itching to just write a quick not to tell you how fantastic I think this is and now I have the chance. This is a great piece and I hope this link stays accessible for a long time because I will be recommending it to many of my students and to many other people. You have very clearly articulated a very important point about how arguments should proceed that is topical inasmuch as it is so often overlooked in contemporary discussions.</p>

<p> I saw an example, just yesterday, of similar problems to those you highlight. Tony Abbott presented a power bill in parliament claiming its near doubling was because of the carbon tax, only to be shown that the lady whose bill it was had nearly doubled her power use and that accounted for the increase. Interestingly, a day later an on-line news source reported that the lady still maintains that the carbon tax was responsible for the big increase, or at least more than the 9% stated on her bill. Why, in all seriousness, would a news source report the opinions of someone whose point is that they don&#39;t accept an objectively-true fact?</p>

      <p>Thanks for the kind words on the article, Guy, they&#39;re very much appreciated.</p>

<p>That is just bizarre - did they give any reason why she still blamed the carbon tax? Was she so upset by the carbon tax she had to turn on every fan in the house to cheer herself up? Did the carbon tax make her buy a rock tumbler or something?

      <p>Yes, It was truly silly. The story I read said: &quot;The bill from power firm Synergy also clearly stated that bills were going up by about 9.13 per cent because of the carbon tax.&quot; ...&quot;Mrs Verolme believed the increase in her bill due to the carbon tax was more like 20 per cent &quot;&quot;I did the calculation this morning and it looks something like 19 point something, nearly or 20 per cent.&quot;&quot; </p>

<p>So there you have it, she did her own maths (who knows how because she&#39;d not have had access to all the necessary variables) and came up with a different figure than what is stated on the bill and believes her own calculation is more believable than the black-and-white figure on her bill. And, this gets reported as news! The headline was &quot;Pensioner backs Abbott&quot;, it could easily have been &quot;Pensioner disputes fact but fails to demonstrate how she&#39;s correct to do so&quot;.  </p>

<p> The article I was thinking of is here: <a href="http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/pensioner-backs-abbott-on-bill-20121011-27fau.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/pensioner-backs-abbott-on-bill-20121011-27fau.html</a> </p>

<p>There&#39;s no escaping the fact that we&#39;re all entitled to an opinion, as you note in your article (despite the headline). But you suggest we should actively throttle some opinions because they enjoy more popularity than you would like to see. The arbiter here, you suggest, should be &#39;authority&#39;. It strikes me as a curious appeal for a philosopher to make. </p>

<p>We do need to carefully scrutinise arguments we (or others) find attractive. But to do so on the basis of authority is foolish. Science is all about enabling valuable arguments to bubble to the top through robust discussion. When policy is debated many things are taken into account, including advice from so-called &#39;experts&#39;, which frequently differs (sometimes substantially and other times not so). But we should never hand the decision making process to a group of (usually interested) experts. Someone who is expert in the field of immunology will likely know precious little about the practical value in a community of a vaccine. I believe there is no qualification which elevates one to the position of &#39;authority&#39; on this question. Researchers are too specialised in their field. GP&#39;s are by and large hopelessly uninformed. I would listen to all their arguments however.</p>

<p>Meryl Dorey has had the good grace to appear here and open herself to your readers. She is obviously willing to have her arguments examined. Unfortunately some have chosen to attack her on the basis that she isn&#39;t a recognised authority. Your editor/moderator has allowed unhelpful comments aimed at a personal level, presumably because the article tacitly invited them. These comments rely almost exclusively on appeal to authority. But ultimately the value of her opinions is found in the strength of her arguments. </p>

<p>The rational approach is to debate the topic rather than the person. If your readers aren&#39;t interested in doing this, they should simply ignore her opinions. If she&#39;s having an impact on the wider community, and they don&#39;t like it, the only acceptable option is to address her arguments. Alternatively they could call to censor, which is what Meryl claims is happening, and indeed what you appear to be encouraging. Those who attack her lack of recognised status as an authority, or worse, her perceived character, display a weakness in their own position, and do nothing but damage the image of scientists and philosophers in general. </p>

<p>Obviously this is not the place to weigh the competing arguments on vaccination, but nor is it the place to crucify someone on the altar of authority. Remember, strong arguments don&#39;t need authority for their foundation. Weak ones, on the other hand, frequently depend on it. I think your slip is showing.</p>

      <p>&quot;Remember, strong arguments don&#39;t need authority for their foundation&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s right Greg. As Patrick explained eloquently they need evidence. And where does this evidence come from? From science. And who practices this science, and relays its discoveries to society? Scientists. That&#39;s right Greg, EXPERTS in immunology do that. Can non-experts present counter evidence? There is non censorship against them trying. Will they be taken seriously? Only if the evidence is good. There is no conspiracy against the provision of good evidence here.</p>

<p>You can pin your *argument from authority fallacy* tail on the evidence donkey all you like. It will fall off.</p>

      <p>&quot;Someone who is expert in the field of immunology will likely know precious little about the practical value in a community of a vaccine.&quot;</p>

<p>Lets test this claim by applying it in other domains:</p>

<p>&quot;Someone who is expert in the field of air traffic control will likely know precious little about the practical value in a community of radar.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Someone who is expert in the field of tourism / hospitality will likely know precious little about the practical value in a community of a hotel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Someone who is expert in the field of information technology will likely know precious little about the practical value in a community of an internet connection.&quot;</p>

<p>Epic fail, Greg.</p>

      <p>Hi Greg,</p>

<p>Sorry for the long and somewhat clunky line-by-line response that follows:</p>

<p>1. “There&#39;s no escaping the fact that we&#39;re all entitled to an opinion, as you note in your article (despite the headline).”</p>

<p>- In the relatively thin sense of ‘entitlement’ I identify in the article, yes, but not in the thick sense I discuss (hence the title, which I chose and for which I take full responsibility).</p>

<p>2. “But you suggest we should actively throttle some opinions because they enjoy more popularity than you would like to see.”</p>

<p>- That&#39;s simply not an accurate gloss of what I said. I’m not suggesting some opinions be ‘throttled,’ I’m suggesting we’re not obliged to take them seriously. Nor am I worried by how ‘popular’ they are per se, I’m worried that they’re scientifically unsupported and, given the subject matter, dangerously irresponsible.</p>

<p>3. “The arbiter here, you suggest, should be &#39;authority&#39;. It strikes me as a curious appeal for a philosopher to make. We do need to carefully scrutinise arguments we (or others) find attractive. But to do so on the basis of authority is foolish.”</p>

<p>- It’s a common misconception that appeals to argument are automatically fallacious. They only become fallacious when a) the authority is irrelevant to the question and/or b) we use the appeal to claim more than it can do. Neither a) nor b) is the case when we claim, as I do here, that scientists have authority over non-scientists with respect to (and only with respect to) scientific questions. The downside of our exponentially-expanding knowledge base is that we’ve ended up with fields of knowledge so complex and specialized that technical training and qualification is a prerequisite for being able to speak with any authority about them. Or to put it bluntly: expertise matters.</p>

<p>4.“When policy is debated many things are taken into account, including advice from so-called &#39;experts&#39;, which frequently differs (sometimes substantially and other times not so). But we should never hand the decision making process to a group of (usually interested) experts.”</p>

<p>- No-one is suggesting we do that. As I made clear, policy responses to science are a separate matter to the science itself. The benefits and risks of vaccines is a wholly empirical question, and we have precisely one massively successful paradigm for understanding and intervening in empirical reality. Now, if you want to argue that, say, individual autonomy trumps collective welfare, or that there are other moral or policy questions raised by vaccination, that’s another matter entirely. But we need to be clear about what we’re talking about. “No-one has the right to force me to vaccinate my children” is a moral statement, and needs to be argued for morally. We’re all moral agents, and we can all argue for or against such a view. “Vaccines cause autism,” by contrast, is a scientific question and needs to be argued for through the techniques and evidentiary standards of science. At this point in the development of the species, only scientists with specialised training in the relevant area can do that. Whether that statement will count as ‘true’ or ‘false’ will therefore be wholly a function of the prevailing view among those scientists. Let’s just re-state that so there’s no misunderstanding here: with empirical questions, we have no direct access to the ‘fact of the matter;’ we have only the prevailing scientific view at any given time. (For the record, I’m comfortable with the idea that we have other ‘ways of knowing,’ but not as they apply to the physical world).</p>

<p>5. “Someone who is expert in the field of immunology will likely know precious little about the practical value in a community of a vaccine. I believe there is no qualification which elevates one to the position of &#39;authority&#39; on this question. Researchers are too specialised in their field.”</p>

<p>- One would think the ‘practical value’ of a vaccine is whether it lessens the incidence of the given disease without producing results as bad or worse than the disease itself. By definition immunologists and those in related disciplines are the *only* people in a position to answer that complex empirical question. If there are other practical questions then it becomes a policy question, and yes, that’s a broader discussion. But again, we have to avoid conflating the science and the practical responses to it.</p>

<p>6. “GP&#39;s are by and large hopelessly uninformed. I would listen to all their arguments however.”</p>

<p>- Uninformed relative to what standards? The only relevant standards here being medical ones, the only people in a position to judge that would be medical experts. </p>

<p>7. “Meryl Dorey has had the good grace to appear here and open herself to your readers. She is obviously willing to have her arguments examined.”</p>

<p>- I&#39;m very pleased to see her exercising her right to post here, and if Ms. Dorey wants to enter a scientific debate, great. But there are rules of evidence and argument that have to apply in a scientific debate. If Ms. Dorey wants to conduct research, write up her findings, and submit them for peer review, then provided she adheres to appropriate research ethics etc. that’s fine. But that, and that alone, is how scientific questions are examined (see my point about our limited epistemic situation in point 4 above).</p>

<p>8. “Unfortunately some have chosen to attack her on the basis that she isn&#39;t a recognised authority. Your editor/moderator has allowed unhelpful comments aimed at a personal level, presumably because the article tacitly invited them. These comments rely almost exclusively on appeal to authority.” </p>

<p>- It’s not attacking someone on a personal level to say that when people make pronouncements they’re not qualified to make, they do not have any prima facie entitlement to be taken seriously. </p>

<p>9. “But ultimately the value of her opinions is found in the strength of her arguments.” </p>

<p>- Again, if Ms. Dorey or anyone else wants to make philosophical/ethical/political arguments, that is true. But if she or anyone else wants to make scientific claims, that has to happen in peer-reviewed journals if it is to have any validity at all.</p>

<p>10. “The rational approach is to debate the topic rather than the person. If your readers aren&#39;t interested in doing this, they should simply ignore her opinions. If she&#39;s having an impact on the wider community, and they don&#39;t like it, the only acceptable option is to address her arguments.”</p>

<p>- Except that every time someone claims “Vaccines cause autism!” and science responds “Actually we’ve found no evidence of that” the original claims just keep being re-asserted. Exactly how many times does an argument have to be ‘addressed’ before those making it modify or abandon their claims? Is that not also a non-negotiable tenet of rational discussion – that you admit when you’ve been proven to be wrong? </p>

<p>11. “Alternatively they could call to censor, which is what Meryl claims is happening, and indeed what you appear to be encouraging.”</p>

<p>- Again, this is clearly not what I said and is not entailed by anything I said either. Consider again the distinction I drew between the two senses of ‘entitlement’ in the article. Censorship would be preventing a view from being expressed i.e. violating the thin sense of entitlement. Not giving equal airtime to all views when not all views have equal standing within the topic does not violate the thin sense of entitlement; hence, declining to give unqualified views airtime alongside overwhelming scientific consensus as if both were equally valid isn’t censorship. </p>

<p>12. “Those who attack her lack of recognised status as an authority, or worse, her perceived character, display a weakness in their own position, and do nothing but damage the image of scientists and philosophers in general.” </p>

<p>- As far as I know I’m the only philosopher commenting here at present, and I think (and certainly would hope) I’ve steered pretty clear of ad hom (as per my response to no.8). I’m not sure how it weakens a scientific argument to point out that the person making the counter-argument doesn’t possess the relevant qualifications to evaluate the evidence.</p>

<p>13. “Obviously this is not the place to weigh the competing arguments on vaccination, but nor is it the place to crucify someone on the altar of authority. Remember, strong arguments don&#39;t need authority for their foundation. Weak ones, on the other hand, frequently depend on it.”</p>

<p>- That would be true if we lived in a world where each and every one of us was qualified to evaluate the merit of every argument. Unfortunately this simply isn’t the case with respect to scientific questions.  If you want to call that worshipping at an ‘altar of authority,’ fine. I’d suggest that’s preferable to sacrificing the value of expertise – and by extension the value of advanced education – in the name of our need to feel we’re entitled to have our views taken seriously regardless of qualification.</p>

<p>14. &quot;I think your slip is showing&quot;</p>

<p>- Argh! I knew wearing a dress today was a mistake...</p>

<p>Best regards,
<br />Patrick</p>

      <p>Greg Beattie - you have just conclusively proven to me that you hold a strong bias against educated, knowledgeable and experienced people.  Time and time again I have seen your attempts to take down people who are experts in their field, no matter what that field may be.  I wonder what the psychology is of that behaviour?  Is it education envy?  Intellectual envy?  Perhaps it is simply that you believe that you are more intelligent than these people be they nurses, doctors, immunologists or philosophers.</p>

<p>You showed your true colours when you finished your post with the misogynist, sexist comment &quot;I think your slip is showing&quot;. Is that where you had to go?  Implying that Patrick was behaving like a woman and therefore his beliefs and arguments were not worthy of a man.</p>

<p>You are all class Greg.</p>

      <p>Greg Beattie says &quot;Science is all about enabling valuable arguments to bubble to the top through robust discussion. &quot;</p>

<p>Not so, Mr Beattie - science is about testing &quot;valuable arguments&quot; rigorously, looking at the evidence, and rejecting or revising the &quot;argument&quot; on the basis of the findings.</p>

<p>The arguments raised repeatedly by yourself, Ms Dorey and others have been examined and de-bunked, also repeatedly.</p>

<p>People who are inexpert in the area the argue about frequently use the (derogatory) allegation &#39;experts&#39;&#39;, as if having knowledge, training and experience in an specific area of practice somehow disqualifies you from commenting in your own area.</p>

<p>What instead - prefer the views of the untrained and inexperienced because they are not &#39;experts&#39;?</p>

      <p>Dear Greg,
<br />I think we all know people who have become so open minded that their brains have fallen out.
<br />I repeat, it is entirely valid to dismiss arguments that have been proven wrong to our own safisfaction and when that happens- to feel that someone should have the good grace to stop repeating those things. It is not wrong- especially when the result of such inane stubborness is to harm unwitting people who think that they should be able to believe what is publically espouced.</p>

<p>You, of course are free to allow such harm to you and yours, and all we can do is grieve BUT do not expect us to rejoice in ignorance nor celebrate its application. Some of us feel duty bound to humanity to tell the TRUTH.</p>

<p>Thanks for your friendly reply. I&#39;ll make this brief because I&#39;m travelling and in and out of reception.</p>

<p>You say an appeal to authority is not automatically fallacious. Sure, but take note: I didn&#39;t claim your argument was fallacious. I said it was weak, as it rested exclusively on the appeal. The same applies to your commenters who&#39;ve joined you in the attack on Meryl. </p>

<p>Thanks for your friendly reply. I&#39;ll make this brief because I&#39;m travelling and in and out of reception.</p>

<p>You say an appeal to authority is not automatically fallacious. Sure, but take note: I didn&#39;t claim your argument was fallacious. I said it was weak, as it rested exclusively on the appeal. The same applies to your commenters who&#39;ve joined you in the attack on Meryl. </p>

<p>As for the thrust of your article, I don&#39;t accept that all you&#39;re trying to say is some opinions deserve more weight than others. I&#39;ll tell you why. We all already know that some opinions deserve more weight. That&#39;s a given. Right or wrongly, we all tend to favour opinions and arguments pitched by experts. There&#39;s no need to throw your weight behind that notion. It simply doesn&#39;t make for an article worth writing or reading, in my opinion. </p>

<p>Think about it this way: the main thrust of Meryl&#39;s argument is that there are problems with the popular orthodox viewpoint. You write an article claiming she can&#39;t be taken seriously because she&#39;s not of the popular orthodoxy! Do I need to point out that if that&#39;s all you&#39;re saying then you&#39;re not really saying much?</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s quite obvious you&#39;re trying to convey much more. The reason I think this is you coloured the article in the following ways:</p>

<p>1. You made refernce to Meryl&#39;s views as &#39;bulldust&#39;. Sure you didn&#39;t use your own words to do so because, as you pointed out, you aren&#39;t qualified to make that call. Only experts are. In this case your expert was TV presenter Jonathon Holmes.... mmm.</p>

<p>2. &quot;Meryl Dorey is the leader of the Australian Vaccination Network, which despite the name is vehemently anti-vaccine.&quot; What do you suggest they change the name to? (Please don&#39;t say you don&#39;t know enough about the AVN to make that call).</p>

<p>3. The title is: &quot;No, you&#39;re not entitled to your opinion&quot;. A title like that certainly sets the scene for a censorship call, don&#39;t you think? And surely censorship is merely the end play of a gradual campaign aimed at eroding the freedom to express, and broadcast. </p>

<p>So, in summary, I think you certainly are 1. buying into the scientific argument, although in a weak fashion, and 2. making a call designed to encourage censorship. I think it&#39;s fairly plain to see you don&#39;t like the fact that some media broadcasters have shown interest in Meryl&#39;s views. But ultimately, they&#39;ve shown interest because people have shown interest.</p>

<p>An argument which doesn&#39;t have the support of authority needs to be quite robust/appealing to get anywhere. Meryl has gained some followers and Mediawatch (and now you) have responded with a call to diminish the effect she&#39;s having. Right or wrong, that&#39;s what you&#39;re doing. </p>

<p>I hope you didn&#39;t take my &quot;slip&quot; comment the way Linda did. I don&#39;t know how she dragged what she did from it. It refers to someone being unaware of a flaw in their outfit: one which others can see quite easily due to the fact that they&#39;re looking from a different angle. Like someone pointing out your fly is undone. In this case you presented yourself as a philosopher, but your argument was exclusively based on appeal to authority. I know you reject this, and I suppose I have to defer to your judgement, in line with the article. :-)</p>

<p>I know I&#39;m pulling your rope a bit here. I&#39;ve no doubt you have a greater knowledge and understanding of philosophy than I do, but I would hazard a guess and say you possibly don&#39;t know much about the vaccine issue. Perhaps you don&#39;t even understand why Meryl holds her views. Perhaps you don&#39;t want to know because you feel it&#39;s not your business. Your a philosopher... not a doctor, right? And only doctors should involve themselves with such things. </p>

<p>The other issue I&#39;d like to address is that of who the &#39;experts&#39; are. Someone took exception to me enclosing the word in quotes, but I do that because it&#39;s difficult to work out who the experts are. I know you disagree with this also, but I&#39;ll have to write more later (providing comments don&#39;t get closed down). I&#39;ve been traveling for work and have just arrived in a city and managed to get internet access, and to be honest I&#39;m tired. I said I would be brief but it turned out not so. </p>

<p>Thanks again
<br />Greg

<p>OK. Now to the question of who the &#39;experts&#39; are. I understand you regard this as a straighforward question with a straightforward answer: namely doctors (and particularly immunologists). But as I said earlier, I suspect you don&#39;t know much about the &#39;issue&#39;. I take a more careful approach and suggest we need to first consider what our questions are.

<p>OK. Now to the question of who the &#39;experts&#39; are. I understand you regard this as a straighforward question with a straightforward answer: namely doctors (and particularly immunologists). But as I said earlier, I suspect you don&#39;t know much about the &#39;issue&#39;. I take a more careful approach and suggest we need to first consider what our questions are. Let&#39;s start with benefit. As consumers we&#39;re surely interested in evaluating this first to give us something against which to compare the likelihood of harm. So we&#39;re going to be looking for an expert who knows its track record: someone familiar with the empirical evidence and able to answer, for example: &quot;How has vaccination affected mortality and morbidity?&quot;</p>

<p>Immunology is the study of the &#39;immune system&#39;. As such it doesn&#39;t offer any expertise to our question. I&#39;ll cut to the chase... it&#39;s no secret other doctors are similarly unsuitable, with the exception of epidemiologists. So why don&#39;t we ask epidemiologists? Well we could but most of them haven&#39;t looked at the question. In fact, one of them commenting here readily admits (Candice, in another forum) she has litle knowledge of the relevant data. So what is this unified voice with which everyone speaks when describing vaccination as the most successful medical intervention ever? Or when it tells the story of how vaccines delivered us from the dark days of unbearably high death rates? Well, it&#39;s a choir simply singing a well known song.</p>

<p>Hence suggesting consumers need to rely on experts for their answers is already looking a little more problematic than initially thought. The relevant experts are not where we thought they would be, and the loud choir is largely an army of faithful drones. (And I ask other commenters to resist the temptation to accuse me of disrespect re the term &#39;drones&#39;. I use it here as a shorthand to describe those who don&#39;t investige but are happy to sing the song.) Still that doesn&#39;t mean the song is wrong. But wait... there&#39;s more. </p>

<p>We don&#39;t actually need experts for this. We can look at it ourselves. Of course few want to go to that trouble. Most simply listen to the choir, like you suggest. But what if there are compelling arguments suggesting the choir is off-key? Ironically, it was well-known philosopher, Ivan Illich, who compelled me to question things a long time ago. He claimed the choir&#39;s song was completely wrong. I found this confronting, and realised I could actually check for myself. It didn&#39;t require any specialised skills, just a modest numeracy and analytic ability, both of which I had. So that&#39;s what I did. It wasn&#39;t hard. It was tedious, but not challenging from a skills perspective.</p>

<p>So now we have two changes. First, those we initially thought were the experts, in fact aren&#39;t. Second, those we initially thought were helpless (ourselves), in fact aren&#39;t. We have the capability to evaluate things ourselves to an extent. Sure, it&#39;s not everyone&#39;s cup of tea but we can do so if we wish. So Patrick, I think you are way off base when you say medical people in general, and immunologists in particular, are the &#39;only&#39; people in a position to judge.</p>

<p>But what about other issues such as the autism controversy? Should we venture that far? To cut a long story short, many who look into the previous question conclude the song is in fact not in line with the evidence. Vaccines didn&#39;t deliver us from those horrid scenes of death and misery. What part did they play? Probably precious little. Possibly nothing. The most reliable data suggests no role whatsoever. But the choir.... what about the unified voice of the experts? Remember this is the fundamental claim used to market vaccination. And there, Patrick, is the issue. The choir is indeed singing in unison, the vast majority blissfully unaware of the song. And these are the experts we defer to for our remaining questions! </p>

<p>You must realise this is not a pure science we&#39;re talking about. It&#39;s open to interpretation. Some will agree with the conclusions I mention above. Others won&#39;t. There are various viewpoints arising from the evidence (and a significant amount of the variance is among medically trained people). The fact that 90-something percent of the choir is singing in unison means little if 90-something percent are just following the others. The song may be right or it may be wrong. But to suggest we leave it up to the choir to decide is, let me say it.... &#39;bulldust&#39;. It&#39;s perfectly reasonable to question. Most don&#39;t. They simply hear the loud choir and conclude it must be beyond question. I believe that&#39;s roughly where you sit at present, Patrick. </p>

<p>Those are my thoughts. I apologise for the length. It&#39;s a complex issue. 
<br />All the best.</p>

Not without a major effort at unpacking assumptions, thoughts they are oblivious to, leaps over the obvious...</p>

<p>Give me someone with knowledge and ideas over an expert anytime.</p>

<p>Unless you want your diesel tuned.</p>

<p>One of the things that seems to emerge in these discussions is that for some folks they have no idea what investigation and research actually involves... that there are no rules or tests... one just gets a bee in one&#39;s bonnet and starts reading similars... and there it is ... lots of other folks saying the same thing and that&#39;s evidence innit?   </p>

<p>For some folks schooling has failed them badly.  They have not learned to learn.  They do not learn - they prop up a starting position. They dismiss &quot;learning&quot; ... a conspiracy of vested interests...there is no real information ... no Truth... science doesn&#39;t know, so my guess is as good as theirs.</p>

<p>The information hyperplasma has given these folks a voice. Friends.  Supporters. Believers.  Dressing gowns and foil beanies.</p>

<p>What is to be done?</p>

      <p>Hi Greg,</p>

<p>Sorry for the delayed reply; the dreaded marking monster is stirring again – and for that reason this reply will be a little truncated. Might have more to add later.</p>

<p>I’m not saying Ms Dorey shouldn’t be taken seriously simply because she disagrees with the popular orthodoxy (by which I assume you mean the prevalent view among researchers and practitioners within the relevant disciplines). But there are two ways you could critique such orthodoxy. You can either make a case within the canons of scientific research, or you can attack the scientific paradigm from the outside. If you’re going to do the former, quite simply you have to have the training (more on this below), and you have to abide by the evidentiary standards of that paradigm. If you’re going to argue against science from without, that’s a very different kettle of fish. In that case, you need to defend another knowledge paradigm and show it to be as or more effective at explaining and manipulating the physical universe. What it’s not open to us to do is to make scientific claims while not working to the evidentiary standards of science, as those standards define the truth-value of a scientific claim. </p>

<p>In short, you can play soccer, or you can play rugby, but what you can’t do is pick up the ball and then insist you’re still playing soccer, only better. </p>

<p>Now, you say that it’s “a given” that “we all tend to favour opinions and arguments pitched by experts” and thus “There&#39;s no need to throw your weight behind that notion.” Yet you go on to assert that it only takes “just a modest numeracy and analytic ability” in order to start critiquing claims made within science. </p>

<p>Let’s just dwell on that for a minute: you presume that your self-described “modest numeracy and analytic ability” (and I’m sure you’re being too modest here) are sufficient to trump people who have the same ability *plus* extensive training *in their field*. And that is indeed one of the reasons why I felt the need to write the article and why weight needed to be thrown behind it: this widespread assumption that there’s no special insight conferred by advanced education, that ‘anyone can do it.’ It’s the whole “I went to the School of Life!” retort writ large. </p>

<p>One of our guys, Rene Descartes, wrote “Of all things, good sense is the most fairly distributed: everyone thinks he is so well supplied with it that even those who are the hardest to satisfy in every other respect never desire more of it than they already have.” We all trust our ‘common sense,’ and it’s very hard to accept that when our common sense conflicts with what someone with advanced knowledge tells us that it’s our common sense that has to yield. (Actually I’ve had precisely this argument with 9/11 ‘Truthers’ before: my rudimentary high school maths doesn’t trump what an engineer says, no matter how self-evident things seem to me – because in addition to an engineering degree, he did high school maths too. And unlike me, he presumably didn’t suck at it). But that’s how it is, I’m afraid. As I said in my last post, this is the price we pay for advanced knowledge as a species.</p>

<p>You suggest that there are no ‘experts’ available on the present topic. I’ll leave it to others to point to the epidemiological literature on this. But here’s where your choir metaphor breaks down: if 90% are apparently singing in tune and 10% are off, the audience, being astute music critics, can say which is singing ‘correctly’ and which is wrong. However, when we’re talking science, ‘truth’ is simply a function of the weight of findings. There’s no external right or wrong for the ‘audience’ to judge the ‘choir’ against. So your claim that “to suggest we leave it up to the choir to decide is, let me say it.... &#39;bulldust&#39;” falls down here, because if we agree these are scientific questions, there’s no-one else to decide.  Scientific questions have to be decided scientifically; there’s no other available standard of truth for such questions. Now again, if you’re going to argue that we have ways of getting at the nature of physical reality other than science, let’s hear it. Otherwise, you can either sit in the pews or join the choir. But as with a real choir, raw talent isn’t enough – you need the training.</p>

<p>On the name of the AVN: my point was simply that, given that vaccination is widely reckoned to be a good thing, one would think an organization of that name would be pro-vaccine or at least neutral. You’d be surprised if the Australian Breastfeeding Association turned out to be anti-breastfeeding, or if the Cancer Council turned out to be pro-cancer.</p>

<p>I don’t think my article title “sets the scene for a censorship call,” no. That particular slope would need quite a lot of greasing to get to the slippery stage. All I am saying is that fringe views that are not backed by relevant expertise don’t have a prima facie case to be taken seriously in the interests of ‘balance.’ A right to free speech doesn’t mean everyone gets a turn on the megaphone. I take it that’s also the point Jonathan Holmes was making, and being an ethical/policy point it’s one that he, me, you and anyone else can defend or contest. I understand that on the AVN page today Ms Dorey wrote that “yes, you ARE entitled to your own opinion on this and every other issue, as opposed to what Patrick Stokes has said - Australia is still a democracy.” Indeed it is, thankfully. And in a democracy each of us exercises a tiny amount of power over each other. That in turn creates a moral responsibility to make sure that we can back up our views – otherwise we’re just using that power arbitrarily.</p>

<p>You also note that Ms Dorey has attracted considerable attention and interest. But that makes not a jot of difference to the scientific validity of what she says. Likewise, the reasons why Ms. Dorey holds the views she does also have no impact on their scientific validity. You speak of “many who look into the previous question” and have concluded otherwise – then let them publish in peer-reviewed outlets. That’s where the action is.</p>

<p>All best,
<br />Patrick</p>

Should GP&#39;s, who have no specialised training for our questions, bend our ears more than others? What about people who are self-educated? Some examples:</p>

<p>Darwin and Wallace (evolution, geology, geography...)
<br />Faraday (electricity)
<br />Herschel (astronomy)
<br />Ramanujan (mathematics)
<br />Mary Anning (geology)
<br />Mendel (genetics)</p>

<p>These were some of the most influential scientists of all time, and all changed our world profoundly, despite no formal training in science. Einstein also had some interesting views on formal education. A couple of his quotes:</p>

<p>&quot;It is a miracle that curiosity survives formal education.&quot;
<br />&quot;The only thing that interferes with my learning is my education.&quot;</p>

<p>So formal education is certainly not a prerequisite for contributing to or discussing science. </p>

<p>Quoting you - &quot;What it’s not open to us to do is to make scientific claims while not working to the evidentiary standards of science, as those standards define the truth-value of a scientific claim.&quot; I don&#39;t think anyone here is proposing that. As I said, Meryl is asking to be judged by her arguments rather than by people&#39;s perceptions of her &#39;self&#39; or how educated she is. This is a very reasonable request. I&#39;d argue true science would regard it as an expectation.
<br /> 
<br />2. Regarding the notion that we all have a tendency to defer to experts, you say I don&#39;t trump someone with similar ability plus extra training in their field. Sure, but that wasn&#39;t at all what I said. I said that (for example) immunologists are not in a better position by virtue of their extra training, unless that extra training is directly relevant to the question. And in relation to the questions I raised earlier, it most certainly isn&#39;t. I would add that they&#39;re obviously in a worse position if they haven&#39;t investigated the question anyway. Remember, you initially assumed immunologists were the &#39;experts&#39;. This was a poor assumption, and your conclusion was based on it. Their specialised training won&#39;t help for the questions I posed earlier. It may help them shed light on mechanisms by which vaccines may help or harm our bodies, but it gives them no special skill in evaluating their track record in preventing death or suffering; nor of them doing so safely. And these are our primary questions. Although immunologists may be some of the loudest voices in the choir, remember, they have a vested interest in singing, as I guess do all medical people. </p>

<p>3. You missed the point of my choir analogy. We aren&#39;t trying to gauge how well the choir are singing. I was pointing out that, as it was a choir, we EXPECT them all to be singing the same tune. But that doesn&#39;t mean the tune is the right one. The whole choir may be singing the wrong tune. We can&#39;t judge that simply by noting that they&#39;re all singing the same. Yet that&#39;s the basis of your argument: that the &#39;experts&#39; appear to be singing the same tune. I pointed out that we can expect that, because the choir is populated mostly by &#39;drones&#39;, who have no specialised training to offer the question, and haven&#39;t investigated it anyway. They are simply repeating the opinions of those who claim to have done so, who are very few in number. 
<br />(However, I&#39;ll take the blame for this misunderstanding, as I muddied the analogy by talking about singing off-key.... which you interpreted as the choir not singing together. I meant singing off-key &#39;as a choir&#39;).</p>

<p>Anyway, you shouldn&#39;t be debating this with me because I&#39;m formally trained in music.  :-)</p>

      <p>Greg Beattie - your list of self-taught innovators shows a fundamental misunderstanding of the way scientific knowledge is built.</p>

<p>There is no branch of science - be it astronomy, immunology, geophysics or botany - that is built on the theoriy of a single person.</p>

<p>Yes, thinkers can develop revolutionary ideas. To be useful however, they need to be both feasible and demonstrable, measurable, repeatable. We don&#39;t treat stomach ulcers with anitbiotics just because someone thought it might be a good idea - the evidence was produced, as was the test to detect helicobacter pylori in an individual.</p>

<p>Darwin conceived the theory for evolution of the species, but it was the huge amount of subsequent evidence found that solidified the scientific model.</p>

<p>Your choir analogy - though drawn from your area of expertise - doesn&#39;t work in science. The choir doesn&#39;t keep singing the same tune of lyrics - they are constantly questioned, reviewed, updated. The fact that you are not aware of those processes does not mean that they don&#39;t occur.</p>

<p>If the science is clear, just say so and point to the research. If it&#39;s not, why are yu getting so hot under the collar? Just acknowledge there are gaps and perhaps seek some funding to close those gaps, or wait for the research of others to do so.</p>

<p>Science doesn&#39;t advance by debate, but by discussion and the classic path of  observation, hypothesis, test, This has descended into that &quot;town hall meeting&quot; that somebody mentioned above.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll just make the observation that what is being discussed here is not science, it is risk-management. The pro-vaxers are discussing the stochastic risk to the population, a standard public-health consideration, while the anti-vaxers are dicussing the deterministic risk to individuals. They see that risk as unacceptably high, given the possible hazard presented (ASD). Some of the pro-vaxers have got quite personal in dismissing that concern about a possible hazard, but even if the risk is small, it&#39;s a big issue if your child is the one affected, especially if they suffer severe debilitation.</p>

<p>I have no personal understanding of the topic of vaccines, as I&#39;ve said before, but I:do understand risk and hazard assessment. Given that the hazard of such a deterministic outcome exists, it is not unreasonable to manage it. te question then becomes whether the risk is great enough to outweigh the potential individual benefits.The public health people say it is, the anti-vaxers say it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>What is the quantifiable  risk of a negative deterministic event and what is the quantifiable individual benefit? I think the public health herd immunity  argument is moot, given that the anti-vaxers are asking for an individual choice.</p>

<p>I say this is curious because even the most anarchistic versions of libertarianism acknowledge at least some safety-related collective goods that impose responsibilities on individuals - for instance, the responsibility to fund some sort of police and defence force. One could easily say that herd immunity has a similar structural role to a defence system, with the &#39;enemy&#39; in this case being particular pathogens rather than hostile foreign powers. </p>

<p>I&#39;m also very doubtful we could, with any real ethical seriousness, discuss vaccination as a *wholly* individual question, given the decision to vaccinate is a) made on behalf of another person (i.e. the child) and b) affects other individuals besides (particularly those who cannot be vaccinated, are immuno-compromised etc.).</p>

      <p>I must have been unclear. All I&#39;m saying is that knowing what the stats are isn&#39;t much benefit if you are coming from the POV that no amount of risk to your child is acceptable.</p>

<p>I agree completely with the public health argument and the common good, but unless the pro-vaxers can nominate a zero risk, I suspect the anti-vaxers will remain unconvinced. In that case, it comes down to whether the risk that they pose as unvaccinated potential hosts of the pathogen is sufficient to justify coercion.</p>

<p>My own children were properly vaccinated with no ill-effects as far as can be discerned.</p>

      <p>Ah right, got it. Unfortunately there&#39;s simply no zero-risk option available here, so it&#39;s all about weighing competing risks - and as a species we don&#39;t seem terribly well equipped to assess probability on a first-personal level, as any casino owner can probably attest (while lighting his cigar on a burning Rembrandt and dining on roast unicorn). Asking us to put a reduced risk of an abstract future risk ahead of the very present and visceral fear of being injected with something is no doubt asking us to overcome a lot of evolutionary heritage. But for me and my kids it was a pretty simple decision.</p>

      <p>There&#39;s also the coercion aspect. How much increase in stochastic hazard justifies coercive intervention? Where does parental responsibility give way to state authority?</p>

<p>The response to your assertions says it all in my own estimation and is quite indicative of this battle. The assessement you made was startling especially in light of the rude tactics emplyed by the anit-vaxxers as you call them. They called names and took the personal attacks to new and utterly uncalled for heights of rudenss and yet they have met with measured responses that added more facts. Finally there is some real frustration when they (we) realized that it was clealy disingenous on the part of the antivaxxers to ask for more information- simply tactics thrown like spaghetti against a wall. If I have to pick a side here where it is clear to me that the people who love humanity are on- I choose those who stand with vaccinations and I would bet with my life that they are more noble.

      <p>I think the coercion question is a valid one to consider. Sometimes we do have to compel people to fulfil their obligations to others, but it&#39;s always a serious business and must be well-justified. In this case I&#39;d suggest the relative risks and benefits make the case for it pretty clear.</p>

      <p>I don&#39;t know enough about the subject to comment on whether coercion is justified, so I&#39;ll take your word for it.</p>

<p>The anti-vaxers have some right on their side though, I think. They don&#39;t necessarily deserve ridicule.</p>

        <p>Hi Debra, you seem to be quite willing to require the coercion of others. I wonder if you&#39;d be quite so keen on it if you were the one being compelled to do something you don&#39;t want to do, especially when the primary argument being used to justify the coercion is that it will be good for everybody, while you are of the view that it will be bad for you?</p>

      <p>Hi Debra, you seem to be quite willing to require the coercion of others. I wonder if you&#39;d be quite so keen on it if you were the one being compelled to do something you don&#39;t want to do, especially when the primary argument being used to justify the coercion is that it will be good for everybody, while you are of the view that it will be bad for you?</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to sit back and say with great gravitas &quot;this is a noble cause, everybody must be made to go along with it&quot;, but I&#39;d like to see how you draw the line between noble causes that don&#39;t justify coercion and those that do.</p>

<p>When does the end justify the means and when is it just bullying? Is there any kind of empirical relationship in your mind, or is it simply ad hoc or even post hoc? The public health argument is essentially utilitarian, while the argument from the anti-vaxers is essentally libertarian, with a flavouring of liberalism. It&#39;s not easy to reconcile those two very different approaches, it seems to me, without resorting to a reduction per se in the rights of individuals to self-determine and possibly to take self-protective action. You musn&#39;t forget that the essential argument of the anti-vaxers is that the risk to their kids (of a negative outcome causing an ASD) is of greater import to them than the community benefit justifies. They see childhood diseases like the MMR set as a part of growing up, whilst ASD is seen as a pure negative. Some high-functioning Aspies might dispute that, but more severe debilitation is quite catastrophic.</p>

<p>Simply abusing them as stupid or somehow wilfully obstrucive doesn&#39;t actually address that point and nor does a public health stochastic analysis. The only thing that would be effective is showing that either the childhood diseases are themselves likely to be catastrophic and that they have a high risk of being contracted, or that the vaccines are absolutely benign with respect to the serious side-effects that are being claimed.</p>

<p>If it is your purpose to convince them, then you need to grow a thicker skin and use your superior understanding of the science to make your case.</p>

<p> It can&#39;t possibly be done if there is an assumption of bad faith on either side of the argument..</p>

It has I assure you - to no avail for it is never information that is sought - rather it is another opportunity to put out false &#39;doctrine&quot;- and raise more funds to keep such organizations afloat. Tantamount to killing more people.</p>

<p>I am a mother of five people. When my second precious son was born, I was leery of vaccinations because of this propaganda which seems so reasonable at first glance- especially in light of the supposed cost and when spouted by a zealot - then I got educated and reallized the risk that I was placing MY SON in and everyone else in the community. I think people should be allowed to think and act as they choose and that the community in general = which represents multiple people should equally have the right to say &quot;Sorry you cannot have our resources like school time for your kids- if they bring danger to ours.&quot; With rights come responsibilities. One of those responsibilities in a society is to refrain from trucking danger into the community WILLFULLY. Another is to  become fully and sensibly informed. Another might be to know what you are talking about.</p>

<p>Sometimes I wish anti-vaxxers would all collect together in one community and, in so doing, allow this evidence to be collected. It is already known that measles, for example, is extremely contagious, and infants (who can&#39;t develop immunity) can die from pertussis. </p>

<p>It is only because vaccines have brought disease rates down that anti-vaxxers have the luxury of choosing not to vaccinate without being particularly likely to suffer the ill effects of that choice. </p>

<p>You will never get a zero risk with vaccines, just as you will never get zero risk when choosing what type of vehicle to buy. Parents that do not want to place their children at any risk will never take them (or let them travel) anywhere on roads. Most parents, however, would buy the safest they can afford, and accept whatever risk comes along with it. They concede that the benefits of transport are worth the risk of being driven into by a useless driver. </p>

      <p>Thank you Patrick. I am constantly trying to say this to people. As the time when I am constantly trying to say this is usually in a bar, I am nowhere near as articulate or logical as you. </p>

<p>As a lawyer I am well used to being asked a legal question and, before I have even taken a breath to answer, the questioner launches into telling me what the legal position is. This is usually based on their one experience of getting a divorce/challenging a red light ticket/getting an intervention order etc. If I dare to disagree with their interpretation of the law I am usually told &#39;well, I&#39;m entitled to my opinion&#39;. If I reply that legal processes are not a matter of opinion (clearly jurisprudence is) and I spend lots more time dealing with legal processes than they do, the person will usually just repeat that they are entitled to their opinion. To which I usually reply that I vastly regret spending so many years and paying so much HECs to get a law degree, when clearly I could have spent just as much, but had more fun, sitting in a pub and gathering various &#39;opinions&#39; on how law works.</p>

<p>In future I will simply hand this article to people and go order the drinks while they read it. Satre, of course, said much the same thing beautifully in Anti-Semite and Jew. Perhaps I&#39;ll hand the person both and find someone else to drink with!</p>

      <p>The article makes a statement which I believe is demonstrably false, namely that there is congruence within the ranks of suitably qualified immunologists on this topic, especially in regard to dismissing a proposed vaccine/autism causality.</p>

<p>I have been in contact with immunologists from around the world, and where they are able to operate in an independent framework, they often contend similar things along the lines of minimal vaccine efficacy, and wide ranging adverse reactions.</p>

<p>At the recent Vaccine Safety Conference in Jamaica some of the world’s top professionals in this area presented their ideas and concerns, especially about the effects of aluminium as a vaccine additive, and a possible causal role with a broad range of neurological disorders, auto immune dysfunction, and digestive issues. </p>

<p>I will draw your attention to a few examples:</p>

<p>The senior post doctoral researchers in vaccine safety at the Univeristy of British Columbia, Dr Lucija Tomijanovic and Professor Chris Shaw, contend that aluminium adjuvents are most probably linked to autism..  Their article here:
<br /><a href="http://omsj.org/reports/tomljenovic%202011.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://omsj.org/reports/tomljenovic%202011.pdf</a></p>

<p>Dr Yehuda Shoenfeld, who organised the conference talks about aluminium’s role in auto immune dysfunction here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf8sw3n7xrE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf8sw3n7xrE</a></p>

<p>Professor Shaw on aluminium neuro toxicity here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgw3KNjEJ4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmgw3KNjEJ4</a></p>

<p>Dr Blaylock on aluminium and mercury derived vaccine additives and their health risks: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9DkcpEEBPI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9DkcpEEBPI</a></p>

<p>Dr Susan Markel, a member of the US Board of Pediatrics on childhood vaccines: <a href="http://www.attachmentparentingdoctor.com/vaccinations.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.attachmentparentingdoctor.com/vaccinations.html</a></p>

<p>There’s plenty more…..</p>

<p>In terms of MMR, it is worth noting that it has been banned in Japan since the early 90’s after around 1.3 million adverse reactions were noted. In more recent times an Italian court ruled that it caused a boy’s autism, after drawing upon a considerable body of expert testimony. You can read about it here:
<br /><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2160054/MMR-A-mothers-victory-The-vast-majority-doctors-say-link-triple-jab-autism-Italian-court-case-reignite-controversial-debate.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2160054/MMR-A-mothers-victory-The-vast-majority-doctors-say-link-triple-jab-autism-Italian-court-case-reignite-controversial-debate.html</a></p>

<p>I am not suggesting for a moment that this constitutes definitive proof, but it does illustrate that eminently qualified professionals would disagree with the article&#39;s assertion. The book ‘Vaccine Illusion’ by immunologist Dr Tetyana Obukhanych:
<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Vaccine-Illusion-ebook/dp/B007AW2CLG" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Vaccine-Illusion-ebook/dp/B007AW2CLG</a>
<br />In the introduction she states: &#39;I never imagined myself in this position, least so in the very beginning of my Ph.D. research training in immunology. In fact, at that time, I was very enthusiastic about the concept of vaccination, just like any typical immunologist. However, after years of doing research in immunology, observing scientific activities of my superiors, and analyzing vaccine issues, I realized that vaccination is one of the most deceptive inventions the science could ever convince the world to accept.&#39;</p>

<p>There is much talk of &#39;logic&#39; here, but when eminently qualified immunologists make statements like this, we need to pay attention, be vigilant about dogma and exercise true scientific principles, namely the constant questioning of of the assumptions we operate under. Science must always be open to new inputs.

<p>I cannot comment of your references until I have given the the respect of a thorough reading. Thank you, though for pushing my education forward in these matters.</p>

<p>Initially, though I would remind both of us that there can be no conferences of merit without opposing views no matter how narrowly that expert is focused. On many mainstream issues, we have to look at minutia to continue to move forward.</p>

<p>EVERYONE- most especially the scientists and experts grieve at any detrimental effect but I submit that NOT one of your experts would advocate the whole sale rejection of vaccinations. They just want to see them improved and spend their lives trying to make that happen on a practical level. Upsetting the public with the cutting edge efforts to do so which can be a great PhD thesis, is not what most try to do. They do seem to try to keep the good in place while working furiously to improve things. These are the last people in the world with their heads in the sand, wouldn&#39;t you agree? Now, I am not talking about a few wronglly invested academics but true scientists.</p>

<p>Blaylock is a retired neurosurgeon who is a &quot;born again&quot; anti-vaxer. He has no credibility in that specialist communities of immunology, infectious diseases or paediatrics.</p>

<p>The Italian court decision is likely to be overturned on appeal - it is an illogical legal opinion without the back-up of clinical science.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to manufacture a disagreement between specialists if you only quote the disagreers. Meanwhile, the overwhelming majority of paediatricians, early childhood nurses, GPs, immunologists, infectious diseases specialists and, in fact, parents, continue to agree about the benefits of vaccination and the vast dominance of benefit over risk.</p>

<p>Why do those particular researchers lack credibility?  Is it because they have consistently done shite research that has been disproven, is fraudulent or makes absolutely no sense?  Or is it because they are being quoted by anti-vaxxers?</p>

<p>The other thing too is although it would be unwise to trust an author with a dodgy track record, every so often even &quot;an idiot&quot; can come up with a meritorious idea.  If this is not an example of that, what about the idea is not meritorious. i.e. is it the methods, etc go back to the science, and use that.</p>

<p>Baz,</p>

<p>Sue is correct.  You can&#39;t just quote a couple of authors trouted on an anti-vax site and appeal to their authority.   Why is their research valuable?  What other research supports and does not support their arguments?  Go back to the science.  </p>

<p>Just saying &quot;Scientist said&quot;  doesn&#39;t mean crap.  That&#39;s also the flaw of the main article, when comparing an expert with a non expert opinion.  It doesn&#39;t point out clearly enough that who said it matters less than the merit of what is being said, although, backing up arguments with evidence is clearly the main point and that is not something I&#39;ve seen anti-vaxxers clearly do as yet.  Likewise the difference between an expert and non expert is we&#39;d expect the expert to have evidence to back up the argument.  This is not always true, but it is considerably more likely (hence we&#39;d be more inclined to trust an expert but it is fallacious to appeal to their authority).  </p>

<p>Does that apply to the research you&#39;ve quoted?</p>

<p>Everyone, absolutely everyone, is entitled to their opinion, no matter how crazy it may seem to you or I.  I accept that there should be a level of credence given to scientific experts that is not extended to the lesser informed.  However, let me remind everyone of the fallibilty of science:</p>

<p>Thalidomide</p>

<p>There are an infinite number of examples that anyone can find for themselves of &quot;certain science&quot; turning sour.  For example, I will remind everyone that it was considered the best &quot;scientific&quot; solution to take indigenous children off their parents in Australia during the 20th century.</p>

<p>There is no such thing as an exact science, and to assume there is, is nothing short of ignorance.  In fact, Russel and Whitehead were never even able to mathematically prove that 1 + 1 = 2.  </p>

<p>Now please don&#39;t misinterpret what I am saying. I believe in the big bang theory, and until I see good scientific evidence to the contrary I will continue to believe it.  I believe in evolution and Darwinian theory. I also believe that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.  However, we moved past positivism for a reason.  There is no such thing as proven science, only the best model we have to work with at the time.</p>

<p>Everyone&#39;s opinions should be heard, and yes, most of the time forgotten. But to suggest that an opinion should be ignored, especially if it is because that person doesn&#39;t have a piece of paper to their name. I think Ramanujan is the only response that one can give to that argument. Possibly one of the greatest mathematical minds in history, and almost all of his work was done without a qualification.</p>

Sometimes it appears that lies look like truth if they are said without challenge in the public space.
<br />What I and I think others are saying is - bring it on if it is true and relevant. For example a person named Boz brought forward some cutting edge information which I will avidly read through. What it does is add to the base of knowledge- what it does not do and cannot do is support some of the stances taken here. It can add to and pinpoint POTENTIAL sources of problems and people far more capable that i will decide what if anything to address in these articles which are like arrows pointing to places for improvment. NO ONE is more committed to progress and improvement than these scientists and that is evidenced by the existance of someone like BOZ.  As for the others, I hope you read the comments on the original article for some of these people are panicked by obviously wrong information, others have agendas and perhaps wish to keep their organizations and thus their pay cheques alive and some others are just poop disturbers of the highest magnitude. 
<br />In my field, the best advice I do give is &quot;Wash your hands- alot&quot;.</p>

      <p>Debra - you present a sound and reasoned point of view, but don&#39;t be misled into thinking that the references cited by Boz are &quot;cutting edge&quot; - they demonstrably are not. (see my other comments).</p>

<p>This site is so prone to people quoting abstracts off the net back and forth - generally only having read the title and perhaps the spin summarised in the conclusion. There is a big difference between doing a Google search and re-posting a few abstracts as opposed to reading - and understanding - the actual study, its methodology, its data and its findings.</p>

<p>We could improve the level of debate by citation by requiring anyone referring to a published paper to present a critical analysis - of the entire paper.</p>

      <p>EEEEK!   The Conversation&#39;s diligent editors are aquiver &#39;neath their desks at your suggestion Ms Sue....I have only just emerged from my security blanket myself.   Encouraging critical analysis of academic papers !!!!?  It&#39;s a conversation not a seminar.</p>

<p>And the whole purpose is so that smart well-read characters like yourself can wade in and correct some of the misconceptions and mythology creeping about out here under the cloak of science.  I know I certainly find your contributions most helpful and direct.</p>

<p>But gee Ms Sue, don&#39;t turn it into a seminar with overheads and maybe powerpoint presentations.   Too many years of my life, honestly.   More importantly, how do we expect to know what the myths are unless we let the ANV and the anti-science Galileo Movement et al hurl their stuff onto the table where you lot can dissect it and pull it apart for us.   Quite gladiatorial actually.  Without the mess.</p>

<p>It&#39;s frustrating to read tripe spread about as fact or &quot;cutting edge science&quot; ... cutting edge reality more like - but this is what you valiant educators do isn&#39;t it? ... not just dispense knowledge and wisdom but also confront delusion and ignorance.  We&#39;re knee deep in it out here you know.  </p>

<p>I know - it&#39;s Tuesday and you didn&#39;t really mean it.  One should never mean anything on Tuesdays.</p>

<p>Let me illustrate:</p>

<p>Baz Bardoe posts this:
<br />&quot;The senior post doctoral researchers in vaccine safety at the Univeristy of British Columbia, Dr Lucija Tomijanovic and Professor Chris Shaw, contend that aluminium adjuvents are most probably linked to autism.. Their article here: <a href="http://omsj.org/reports/tomljenovic%202011.pdf&quot" rel="nofollow">http://omsj.org/reports/tomljenovic%202011.pdf&quot</a>;</p>

<p>Sue Ieraci goes to the article, and finds that:
<br />1. Those researchers (whose papers she has previously seen used in anti-vax arguments) are not &quot;researchers in vaccine safety&quot; at all.
<br />2. Their paper is not a research report but a theoretical discourse, which calls for more research.
<br />3. WHere Baz Bardoe says &quot;contend that aluminium adjuvents are most probably linked to autism..&quot;, the actual paper says nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>A reasonable (brief) critical analysis of this paper would then be:
<br />&quot;These authors are researchers within the Neural Dynamics Research Group, Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences, at the University of British Columbia. They have several publications in low-impact journals in the area of vaccination, although this is not their specialty area. The specific paper cited is in a journal of inorganic chemistry. The paper is a theoretical discourse - not a research report. What they do is correlate a rising incidence of ASD diagnoses with an expanding vaccination schedule. This has occurred during a time that ASD has been more precisely defined and more commonly diagnosed. They have only shown correlation of two things - not causation.&quot;</p>

<p>See? No need for powerpoints, graphs or long dissertations. Just a bit of effort and some intellectual honesty</p>

      <p>Patrick,
<br />I appreciate that you are trying to elevate the debate but your argument, like Plato&#39;s is fundamentally flawed. 
<br />Plato&#39;s purpose for distinguishing between opinion (doxa) and &#39;knowledge that is certain&#39;, was so that he could argue that &#39;Reason&#39;, by which we arrive at certainty, is superior to &#39;Opinion&#39;, which is always uncertain. Plato also argued that everything that is uncertain is striving towards certainty.</p>

<p>The problem with his argument is that we come to regard Reason as somehow superior to Opinion. Opinion is often arrived at through intuition and cannot be argued in a logical or mathematical way.</p>

<p>... read John Ralston Saul&#39;s &quot;Voltair&#39;s bastards- The Dictatorship of Reason in the West&quot;... or listen to any political debate to hear how a lie can be couched in a reasonable argument to somehow become the truth;</p>

<p>So because we can&#39;t use logical reasoned arguments to explain certain things, these things always lose the debate.
<br />Alternatively, we then apply &#39;logical arguments&#39; or the scientific method to matters of opinion, testing all the different opinions to find the &#39;correct opinion&#39; or the &#39;ortho - doxa&#39; ... the &#39;orthodox truth&#39;. As a result &#39;opinions&#39; that are accepted by consensus (or enforced through oppressive means) somehow become truths... so they can win the debate.</p>

<p>...and the problem with this is that the &#39;facts&#39; of the establishment become the truth even if they are not. </p>

<p>Just because someone has certain qualifications or is more expert than others does not make them, by definition, the holders of the ALL the facts. </p>

<p>...truth is not a debate or a contest... the holder of more facts or of a more well reasoned argument is not, as if by majority vote, the holder of the truth.

      <p>Hi Stephen,</p>

<p>Thanks for a thoughtful reply – and I always appreciate a John Ralston Saul reference (I enjoyed his earlier books, particularly The Doubter’s Companion, but kind of lost the thread after On Equilibrium).</p>

<p>I think it’s very important not to reify, let alone deify, reason. That’s precisely what Plato does, and that’s one of many reasons I don’t agree with his epistemology. I also agree that intuitions are an irreducible part of our moral, practical and theoretical experience (check out the paper of mine I link to in the article for more on this as it applies to moral intuitions). </p>

<p>That said, acknowledging the limitations of reason – and even giving up on the idea of absolute and final certainty – isn’t the same thing as giving up on the idea that different opinions have different truth-values. The fact that we’re epistemically and cognitively limited don’t entail that anything goes.</p>

<p>You point out, rightly, that a lie can easily be couched in a reasonable-sounding argument, and that consensus and absolute objective truth aren’t the same thing. But that doesn’t mean we must completely give up on standards of rational argument and simply accept a total relativism of competing truth claims. Rather it means we have to accept – which Plato, to his cost, did not – that we do not have, and might never have, access to 100% certainty about anything. Yet that doesn’t vacate the entire concept of truth. Rather it means that truth might be something we always tend towards while being aware of our own ever-present fallibility – and that in turn should warrant a certain intellectual humility with respect to complex questions that have been studied in greater depth by others. It’s that humility that I think is sorely wanting at present, with respect to properly scientific questions at least. </p>

<p>Best wishes,
<br />Patrick</p>

      <p>Hi Patrick, this is a fair way from the subject of vaccinations as useful tool, but I find this concept of humility in the face of greater perceived authority a little troubling. Whilst I agree that those who have arrived at their views through proper application of the scientific method have a more strongly-based claim than someone who relies on intuition or a faulty application of reasoning alone, oftentimes it is a willingness to challenge accepted postulates that lead to the most interesting results. There are any number of examples of well-regarded models being shown to be incomplete or even completely wrong upon application of reason to a different set of postulates to explain the same data set.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t imply that it is always valid to do so, since it clearly can lead to nonsensical results, however it is certainly true that accepted wisdom is not necessarily going to lead to an improved understanding. It is important to distinguish between models and empirically-derived results. A model is only useful insofar as it explains the observations, it is not independent of what can be measured. It has no life of its own.</p>

<p>I know I&#39;m making a lot of what may have been a poorly chosen word, but I don&#39;t see any place for such humility in scientific endeavour. Everything is able to be challenged and must be. The core concept is falsifiability, and it is only through such an approach that useful questions can be asked. Certainly those who have a long history of making observations in a field have some claim to superior understanding of the data set, but having a data set is not the same thing as having an understanding of the mechanisms, or even of having a usefully formulated set of questions, even if the hypotheses that underlie those questions have not been yet falsified. Think of the ructions in mechanics in the early part of last century, where the accepted wisdom of 300 years was challenged and found to have limits, all through the application of reason to a changed set of postulates. The field continues to investigate the implications of quantum mechanics today and there is no guarantee that a similar upheaval will not take place tomorrow. </p>

<p>A &quot;truth&quot; is an observed piece of data, that is all. What is done with that data is what enables understanding, but as you say, it may never be complete except in limited ways. Having the arrogance to challenge accepted models is critical to advance that understanding.</p>

<p>Rather than humility, what is required is good faith in and acceptance of purity of motive. It is that good faith that is lacking in the discussion around vaccination, it seems to me. On both sides.</p>

      <p>Hi Craig,</p>

<p>Thanks for this very helpful comment. </p>

<p>I’d like to suggest that the attitude you’re describing here is actually not opposed to what I mean by intellectual humility. A “willingness to challenge accepted postulates,” and a preparedness to abandon models that aren’t supported by empirical data, would indeed seem to be essential for any kind of research. However, what you (I think quite rightly) call ‘good faith’ in that context will also involve being open to the possibility that one might also be wrong. Falsifiability doesn’t play favourites. So there arguably is a role for intellectual humility even within a disciplinary practice like science, without it amounting to deference to authority.</p>

<p>However the same virtue in different contexts can look very different and issue in different actions. What counts as bravery on a battlefield might not be the same thing as bravery in facing an illness, for example. Likewise, the virtue of intellectual humility within a discipline might look very different to humility on the part of someone outside that discipline with respect *to* that discipline. In that latter context, intellectual humility very likely will involve deference. </p>

<p>In other words, there is a pretty significant difference between scientists challenging other scientists on scientific questions, and non-scientists challenging scientists. Humility will operate very differently in each case. I still think it’s the same virtue operative in each case – though I am, I hope, open to the possibility that I might turn out to be wrong about that!</p>

<p>Best,
<br />Patrick</p>

      <p>Patrick, I&#39;m struggling to properly express this, so please excuse me for perhaps seeming obtuse. </p>

<p>The issue of falsifiability relates to the questions being asked, not to the model that might result from the reasoning process. Confirmation bias is a problem that persists and can impact the most eminent scientific output. Few genuinely independent scientists exist, after all.</p>

<p>New paradigms arise through rationalism informed by empiricism, or sometimes through cognitive leaps that have little obvious basis in empiricism. Whilst I take your point that great learning deserves respect, it seems to me that the greatest thinkers are the ones who have most spectacularly failed to respect learned opinion, while some of the most spectacular failures have been eminent people who have doggedly clung to ideas that have been later shown to be flawed or limited.</p>

<p>This is not to say that divergence from the dominant consensus is axiomatically a good thing - I agree that not all views are equally worthy and some are obviously garbage, but I do think that it is axiomatic that good science is open to new ideas wherever and however they arise. As long as a proposition can be falsified it can yield useful results and new ideas. Negative data is still useful and a gifted or lucky amateur can inform significant investigation.</p>

<p>It seems to me that the deference you describe is essentially a defence of special pleading, in that it relies on a class difference in the source of the opinions rather than on objective evaluation. It may even stultify rather than fertilise fruitful developments.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to discuss this stuff. On a broader level than scientific endeavour our new world of rapid communication and easy dissemination of ideas creates a need for people to swiftly evaluate what they read and far too often that evaluation is informed by some form of confirmation bias. That in turn can lead to a deterioration in the good faith we discussed above and that leads nowhere good, as the catcalling on this thread demonstrates. </p>

<p>It&#39;s a vexed and entrenched issue that deserves proper consideration. With due humility of course :-).</p>

      <p>Patrick, thank you very much for engaging in this conversation... I also lost the thread after JRSaul&#39;s early works. 
<br />I, like Craig, am troubled by the issue of humility before superior knowledge or expertise.</p>

<p>I think we are experiencing a fundamental shift, both in the ways our minds work and consequently in the way in which we, collectively, perceive the world... as our perception changes, our understanding of the truth also changes.</p>

<p>Most of our education systems have to date been based on a very linear model... a growth model, where new knowledge is built on the shoulders of existing knowledge. This is consistent with the use of logic and reason. </p>

<p>This has been extremely useful in building up the body of human knowledge but has meant that in order to continue to build we have to become more and more specialised. Existing knowledge in most disciplines is now so complex that it requires years of reading and learning and research just to get to the frontier of knowledge before you can think of adding to it. When following along this path it is appropriate that we acknowledge with humility those who have trodden this path before us.</p>

<p>I suggested that we are experiencing a fundamental shift because I believe that the internet is changing everything. Access to base level knowledge is significantly greater. This allows for a substantially greater ability to challenge expressed &#39;truths&#39;. As a result, the holders of knowledge are no longer able to bluff their way through... this is particularly evident in government... most governments around the world are being challenged to an unprecedented degree... and &#39;fundamental truths&#39; like &#39;economic growth is good&#39; and so should be the principal purpose of government is no longer accepted. </p>

<p>The democratisation of knowledge, the free access to knowledge, is the best way to arrive at the truth. Provide all the existing knowledge freely to all and allow it to be challenged from any and all angles by all interested parties. This is the foundation of a truly democratic society.</p>

<p>Most of our society consists of churches of knowledge, whether its religion, or science, economics, law, medicine or immunology. The high priests of these churches demand humility, demand that the rest of us bow down to their superior knowledge.</p>

<p>In the same way that the printing press democratised access to knowledge and resulted in both the Protestant revolution and the Enlightenment, so will the internet and social networking again democratise knowledge, taking it out of the hands of self appointed &#39;experts&#39;. It will do this, not using the linear model but by hyperlinking across disciplines to create a connected flow of ideas... and we will know the truth when it resonates across large sections, or all, of the population... not when we are simply told that it is the truth.</p>

<p>The ability to hyper-link across disciplines is an expression of the lateral thinking that is absent from our current systems and I can&#39;t wait to see the explosion of ideas to come.</p>

      <p>&quot;I have spoken with literally hundreds of doctors who are totally clueless on this subject - and that includes immunologists, paediatricians, rheumatologists and other specialists.</p>

<p>As opposed to the opinion of many people here and in the greater community, a degree in medicine does not give one any &#39;magical&#39; powers to determine the truth or otherwise of scientific issues. Doctors are not trained in research and in fact, that majority of their information about drugs and vaccines comes directly from the manufacturers of those same products.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, that&#39;s wrong. As a medical student, I can confidently say that we ARE trained in research because, funnily enough, we need to know how it works and will be expected to keep up with the latest research throughout our career. We&#39;ve never once had a rep from a pharmaceutical company come to uni and teach us about immunology. Strange as it is, immunologists teach us about immunology. And we do study immunology. In fact, I&#39;m studying it this semester. Attempting to claim that said immunologists are &quot;totally clueless on this subject&quot; is, to put it kindly, insane. Seeing as it is the basis of their entire career, they do need to know a little about it.</p>

      <p>On the specific issues of vaccination and gay marriage, most of the evidence supports having both as accepted features of contemporary life, with some caveats (see below).</p>

<p>However, most the arguments, from all the angles I&#39;ve seen thus far, including on this web-page, appeal to authority, popularity, are ad nauseum, ad hominem and generally lacking in the evidence.   It&#39;s tiresome, achieves nothing and neither perspective is winning the fight because of it.  Being berated by anyone on these issues is not working.  </p>

<p>The evidence, to be clear, from what I&#39;ve seen so far suggests:</p>

<p>&gt; Vaccination is an effective force for the social good, if the social good is defined as preventing small children from dying of preventable diseases.  </p>

<p>With one caveat, individual differences in biology/social variables tend to create the occasional situation where what is good for most people is not always good for that individual.  But because doctors are supposed to account for this by taking family medical history, looking for signs of these factors and so on, this issue can be dealt with.  Thus, to deny all children vaccination on the grounds that a handful of cases have not been dealt with effectively in this matter, is throwing the baby out with the bathwater, and increasing the rate of preventable diseases.  It is unscientific and unethical.  On the other hand, was the anti-vaxx argument just about increasing the rate of doctors performing individual evaluations in more detail, that would be an ethical argument and would apply to issues other than vaccination.  Unfortunately, to date, that has not been the case.</p>

<p>&gt; Gay marriage is a force for social good, if the social good includes equal rights and recognition for legal relationships that match contemporary values of non-discrimination.</p>

<p>With one caveat,  a relationship probably should not have to be legally binding for it to be afforded the social acceptance and rights of the individuals involved to freely associate with each other without interference from the broader community.  As homosexual and trans relationships, like heterosexual ones, involve freely associating adults, it ideally shouldn&#39;t matter if they are married or not for the relationship to be valued as equally meaningful to the individuals involved.  In short, if we need marriage to convince others that gay people really are in love and no different from straight people in the nature of their affections,  then our society still has a long way to go before we can say that the book is closed on ending discrimination against homosexual, bisexual and trans people.</p>

      <p>What&#39;s the point of pulling out this old opinion piece for yet another run as a featured article? Is it to remind people that they are not entitled to an opinion on this site unless they have letters after their name? </p>

<p>Well, my opinion hasn&#39;t changed. The author is still narrow minded and short sighted. The Conversation however, has changed into something less than what it was, even a couple of months ago. Maybe because members of the public are not encouraged to have an opinion here any more? Perhaps. Whatever, the Conversation has failed as now all it is, is a small group of like-minded academics talking to each other.</p>

      <p>You&#39;re right, Ian, I am a little short-sighted. Thanks to the wonders of modern optometry though it really doesn&#39;t bother me that much.</p>

<p>As for narrow minded, well if thinking that people need to be able to back up what they&#39;re saying and that expertise matters makes me narrow-minded, I guess I&#39;ll have to live with that tag. I will say that two months and 290k+ views later, I am incredibly grateful for all the feedback, both positive and critical, people have offered on this article - people from all sorts of backgrounds and with all sorts of perspectives. The Conversation makes things like that possible. Sorry to hear you&#39;re not enjoying it.</p>

      <p>I&#39;m in agreement with this article. It&#39;s fair to say that an assertion should be defensible. If what you assert cannot be defended it is irrational, by definition.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there is a suggestion that only people with relevant degrees are entitled to opinions, that would be a fallacious argument from authority. It&#39;s the argument that is relevant, not the arguer. I don&#39;t care who is making the point, if it stands up to scrutiny then it does; if it doesn&#39;t, it doesn&#39;t.</p>

<p>I have a student who recently said &quot;you&#39;re the teacher, so you&#39;re probably right&quot;, I replied that I&#39;m not right because I&#39;m the teacher; I&#39;m right AND I&#39;m the teacher. My rightness had nothing to do with the fact that I am his teacher and everything to do with my assertions being backed by evidence.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also fair to say that music is not rational ... I would not assert that music is therefore irrational as you use that word (i.e. irrational = &#39;wrong&#39;).  As a music teacher I would hope you are showing students that the opposite of rational is intuitive and creative.</p>

<p>Evidence only works in the rational sphere of our world view and new ideas and breakthroughs in knowledge actually challenge the existing rational world view... creativity is all about choosing not to pursue that rational path followed by others.</p>

      <p>Steven Liaros - There are actually many things about music that are perfectly rational. Certain intervals have perfect ratios between them, for example, two strings an octave apart are always in a ratio of 1:2. So, the theory behind music is rational.</p>

<p>What you do with that rational process is not a question of rationality, but preference and value. This is irrelevant to the topic.</p>

<p>You equate &#39;irrational&#39; with &#39;wrong&#39; but this is a problem. You could assert something that is right but for which you have no evidence. Until you have evidence, believing this assertion to be true is irrational, even though it is correct. God is a great example of this: there&#39;s no evidence for His existence, even though He might. To believe it is irrational which is why people need &#39;faith&#39;.</p>

        <p>Chris,
<br />I agree that there is much that is rational about the theory and craft of music... and a teacher of music, as with all disciplines, can only teach the theory and craft. The creative/ artistic element of music is not rational, is far more than &#39;preference and value&#39; and is the only part of music that we (non-musicians) value.</p>

<p>As a teacher of any discipline (but especially music) you can only offer the building blocks, you can only teach the rules that a creative person will break in order…</p>

      <p>Chris,
<br />I agree that there is much that is rational about the theory and craft of music... and a teacher of music, as with all disciplines, can only teach the theory and craft. The creative/ artistic element of music is not rational, is far more than &#39;preference and value&#39; and is the only part of music that we (non-musicians) value.</p>

<p>As a teacher of any discipline (but especially music) you can only offer the building blocks, you can only teach the rules that a creative person will break in order to make beautiful music or art.
<br /> 
<br />This is all very relevant to the topic because those who suggest that more rational knowledge makes you superior are ignoring the evidence of countless great musicians in history who had no or limited knowledge of rational music theory.</p>

<p>Finally, your assertion that God &#39;might&#39; exist (after claiming that his existence is &#39;correct&#39;) proves my point. Either he exists or he does not. If you can prove with a rational argument that he exists then he is not God because he is no longer beyond our understanding.</p>

<p>If he exists and you can&#39;t prove it rationally then that proves that rational processes can only take you part of the way. It also proves that those who insist that he exists are enforcing their opinion as if it was &#39;truth&#39;.</p>

<p>Everyone is entitled to their opinion because everyone is different, has experienced a different life journey and so their music and art will be different ...Rather than insisting that everyone must align themselves with the established enforced truth... we should allow everyone to express themselves honestly and authentically... to express their opinion and to show their creativity, their music and their art.</p>

      <p>I&#39;m kind of torn between about whether or not the rational is independent from the emotional.</p>

<p>But I think it&#39;s fair to say that the most fun in art making seems to come from accepting a fusion of spontaneous ideas and not giving a toss if there&#39;s a basis for it until later.  Sounds rather irrational to me.</p>

      <p>Steve,</p>

<p>You&#39;re playing with a few words dishonestly, or you just don&#39;t know what they mean. I&#39;m willing to grant the latter.</p>

<p>First, You can&#39;t &quot;agree&quot; that much about the theory AND craft of music is rational because I only asserted that the theory of music is rational, not the craft, so this is not agreeing with me. I do agree that the creative/artistic element of music is not rational, but only in the sense that it is not a question of rationality. You say that it&#39;s not a matter of preference and value and then proceed to point out that non-musicians &#39;value&#39; music&#39;s creativity. This is part of the creative process though: What do I value and have preference for (this could relate to sounds, techniques, physical and technical capabilities etc.) and what do my (intended) audience value and have preference for?</p>

<p>As I said in my first post, I&#39;m not going to suggest that this is a stupid argument to have because I have heck loads of musical knowledge to back me up and so therefore I&#39;m right. But all you have to go on is the value you place in music and your preferences, which only serves to prove my point! What is it beyond preference and value that you think is involved?</p>

<p>2. Telling me what I can and can&#39;t teach is pretty dangerous territory. I actually do teach these things and I teach them well. Why can I only teach the rules which they will then break? I teach them the rational theory and I teach them what they can do to move beyond that and get creative, which is, by the way, completely a matter of preference and value. It&#39;s also my job to teach this. Beauty and art I&#39;d like to point out, are matters of preference and value (personal or cultural), so again, you&#39;re proving my point.</p>

<p>I think we need a working definition of creativity to further this part of the conversation, I&#39;m happy to receive amendments. Here&#39;s mine: creativity is taking existing ideas and applying them in new ways.</p>

<p>3. I don&#39;t think anybody is suggesting that having rational knowledge makes you superior. I&#39;m not anyway. More rational, sure, but that&#39;s not superior, unless you measure superiority (which I have no interest in whatsoever) by that marker alone... You&#39;re misunderstanding something about music theory. Music theory, like scientific theories, is a model for how musical concepts interrelate. It is not a set of &#39;rules&#39;, it is a guide to help us understand and organise the things which we have discovered about music. Much as the laws of physics aren&#39;t rules about how physics is required to work, so much as a list of observations about how it does, in fact, work.</p>

<p>Anyway, great musicians without knowledge of music theory had only their preference and value for certain sounds, techniques and other musical ideas to go on.</p>

<p>4. I did not assert that God might exist after claiming that his existence is correct. I said that an assertion can be correct but irrational because you have no evidence for it. I then used God as an example for an irrational belief because of a lack of evidence.</p>

<p>Whether or not God is provable is based on how you define God. You have provided the definition that God is beyond understanding. I&#39;d be interested in discussing this, and I&#39;d ask what the point of something beyond our understanding is (and point out that that&#39;s a paradox because you understand that God is beyond understanding - how do you understand this?), but it&#39;s irrelevant to my main discussion, so I&#39;ll leave it to the side for now... Yes, I know I&#39;m being cheeky getting my point in there.</p>

<p>Something being correct but not provable rationally only shows that it is not yet rationally understood, not that it is beyond understanding. If I don&#39;t know what a chair is made of, it&#39;s irrational to assert that it&#39;s made of wood, even if it is made of wood. I can later prove that it is made of wood, and only at that point is it rational to assert so. I do not assume that because I don&#39;t know something that it cannot be known (that would seem rather arrogant, or at least presumptuous).</p>

<p>I&#39;m in total agreement that anyone insisting God exists is enforcing their opinion as if it was truth. There is absolutely no evidence for His existence. I think you may have thought that I was asserting this, but I think I&#39;ve cleared that up.</p>

<p>5. You&#39;re missing the point about music and art. They are not questions of rationality, there is no &#39;established enforced truth&#39; about music or art. You can&#39;t factually say &quot;this is good art&quot; or &quot;this is bad art&quot;, even less &quot;this is true art&quot; or &quot;this is false art&quot;. You could say these things based on your preferences and values; It&#39;s not a question of rationality. I agree everyone should be able to express themselves artistically however they like (that is according to their preferences and values!) because art has nothing to do with facts.</p>

<p>On matters of fact, however, you should not make assertions that contradict facts without proof and evidence to back up those assertions. Is that so hard to understand?</p>

      <p>Emma Anderson - I agree that the most fun in art does come from improvisation and trying new things. It&#39;s not &#39;irrational&#39; it just has nothing to do with rationality. Just as deciding to eat an orange instead of an apple has little to do with rationality.</p>

<p>unless you&#39;re emulating anthony braxton or elliott carter you&#39;re beholden to a harmonic system which exerts influence on you whether you strain against it or align with it.  it is a rational system evolved in conjunction with the well-tempered scale - even if the answer to &quot;why (for what reason) did you score or play this chord at that time&quot;, is &quot;because i wanted the effect that would ensue&quot; it is rational.</p>

<p>western music is teleological - it is a narrative, normatively, not a process; arguably, the final V-I cadence is implied in the opening progressions &amp; is the destination that every musical event works towards or postpones.</p>

<p>musical inspiration is not necessarily irrational - musical execution is almost always rational &amp; grounded on good technique.  ecstatic exuberance in musical execution is never wholly irrational.  -a.v.</p>

<p>I can kind of run with that on the basis you give. The creation of a sound and its ensuing effect are perfectly rational. The part I think that is based on value and preference is what led to the choice to want to create a particular sound in the first place.

This could be argued to have a rational basis, but I&#39;m not sure if research substantiates this. Anxiety sufferers, for example, often become musicians; It may help to centre and channel emotions better. So an anxiety sufferer&#39;s choice to want to hear a certain sound may very well be backed by rational decisions; it would be just as rational as taking medicine for an ailment.</p>

<p>I&#39;m reluctant to call any musical choice rational because it implies that there are particular solutions to musical &#39;problems&#39;, or situations. In my experience, there are often multiple ways to get where you want to go in music, especially with regard to improvisation; it&#39;s not necessarily a linear activity. So, the choice between these equally valid solutions comes down to preference.

      <p>Chris,
<br />I apologise if you feel that by challenging you and debating with you that I was dishonest and arrogant... perhaps amongst other things. Clearly you feel that I do not have the right to challenge you on the subject of music so I will not pursue those arguments.</p>

<p>I would like to challenge your last paragraph, &quot;On matters of fact, however, you should not make assertions that contradict facts without proof and evidence to back up those assertions. Is that so hard to understand?&quot;
<br />This gets back to the subject of the original article &quot;No, you are not entitled to your opinion&quot;.</p>

<p>My issue is not whether my opinion has merit but whether I&#39;m entitled to express an opinion.</p>

<p>You appear to agree (correct me if I&#39;m putting words in your mouth) that in any human endeavour there is a rational component and a non-rational component. The non-rational component is the domain of intuition, of creativity and of objectivity as well as preference and personal value.</p>

<p>So when you refer to &quot;matters of fact&quot; and even if you then claim to know ALL the facts and to possess ALL the possible rational knowledge in your field of expertise you can&#39;t know everything about it because you can&#39;t &#39;know&#39; the non-rational component ... most importantly you can&#39;t understand your discipline from an objective viewpoint.</p>

<p>If you are schooled in music theory or economic theory or medical theory or religious theory etc. and you build up a body of rational knowledge in your area of expertise and you have invested a huge amount of time in understanding the rational framework and you then teach from the standpoint and your income is derived from your expertise and so your livelihood depends on that income and you also define yourself as an music teacher or an economist or a doctor or a bishop... do you think you will ever accept someone from outside your field to challenge your opinion?</p>

<p>You, like Patrick, the author of the article and a large proportion of the population appear to believe that every discipline is entirely independent of every other discipline and the body of human knowledge is a number of independent strands and no-one outside your strand could possibly understand your discipline. You choose to believe this because it serves your self-interest, it makes you an expert and a teacher. That status gives you personal value and that status guarantees you income and so it sustains your very life.</p>

<p>You therefore insist that without rational proof and evidence no-one is entitled to an opinion. You believe it is unreasonable to allow anyone to challenge your expertise as you have invested so much in building it up. It is unreasonable to entitle anyone to offer an opinion. 
<br />...but then reasonableness is the domain of rationality and it seems you are afraid to step outside of it.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what it comes down to. You certainly have the &#39;right&#39; (although I don&#39;t believe in rights, but that&#39;s another matter) to express your opinion on matters that are not questions of fact, such as the non-rational component of any human endeavour. </p>

      <p>Steve,</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what it comes down to. You certainly have the &#39;right&#39; (although I don&#39;t believe in rights, but that&#39;s another matter) to express your opinion on matters that are not questions of fact, such as the non-rational component of any human endeavour. </p>

<p>You&#39;re welcome to challenge me on anything relating to anything, I was merely suggesting that you&#39;re fighting as much of a losing battle doing so as I would be challenging a surgeon on matters of surgical procedure. This isn&#39;t to protect my apparently lucrative teaching business, and from whom would I be protecting myself by not having this conversation with you? What a confusing statement.</p>

<p>Anyway, here&#39;s what I think people who feel the need to express an opinion on a factual matter should do first: Do some research, find out what the facts are and go from there so that your opinions are not misguided. You are entitled to your own opinions but you are not entitled to your own facts. Furthermore, you are entitled to express those opinions, but it&#39;s a stupid idea to do so because you will be treated like an idiot for making baseless claims. I&#39;m not saying that this is right or wrong, but this is what is going to happen. It&#39;s not worth your trouble to do so and it&#39;s not worth my trouble to hear people&#39;s false facts because they do not help.</p>

<p>A better thing to do is ask questions. Rather than making a statement of &#39;fact&#39; regarding something about which you have no idea, why not ask a question of someone who does know and try to find what the correct answer is? If there is currently no correct answer (maybe more research or better technology is required), the honest thing to do is to say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot;, the dishonest answer is to make something up (that&#39;s the &#39;opinion&#39; that this article is referring to).</p>

<p>In this case, rather than make assertions about musical facts which you admit you have no training in, it would be better to ask: &quot;Is music a rational or irrational endeavour?&quot;, or &quot;which components of music are rational and which are not?&quot;. How you ask that exactly is preferential and you would be welcome to express your opinions about how to ask that question and to do so in your own way. To express your own facts about music is asinine.</p>

<p>Lastly, I have no interest in upholding any kind of status quo. If somebody can point out, with evidence, that something I believe is wrong, guess what I&#39;ll do? I&#39;ll stop believing it. If they can make a positive claim for the existence of something that is factual, I&#39;ll believe that. What I won&#39;t believe is someone&#39;s opinion for which they have no evidence.</p>

      <p>Chris,
<br />Here is what it comes down to in my opinion.
<br />There is no such thing as the very Western idea of right or wrong. Like yin and yang in Chinese philosophy, black and white are simply two sides of the same thing (like day and night, light and dark... light is not &#39;good&#39; and darkness &#39;evil&#39;... they are just two parts of the whole.</p>

<p>In the absence of right and wrong there is no rational truth as we interpret the idea of truth... ie. there is no collection of facts that will take you anywhere meaningful. 
<br />Your collection of &#39;facts&#39; is only your perception of the world. 
<br />Current ideas of right and wrong are only common perceptions or more often ideas that are followed by people who have not thoughtfully inquired but find it easier to follow other people&#39;s established perceptions.</p>

<p>The only meaningful truth is that some things resonate with people and with the natural environment while many more things do not resonate. Like yin and yang again, resonance is an efficient harmony of equal opposites... a &#39;storage and release&#39; of energy, store and release in equal measure (I am sure you will have a different definition). You will find that most scientific or natural &#39;truths&#39; boil down to resonance... and that&#39;s why music is so important, why it touches us on a fundamental level.</p>

<p>The only &#39;truth&#39; is something that resonates not something that is supported by a collection of facts, many of which are founded on perception or self-interest... and so, for example and getting back to the original article, if vaccinations are &#39;good&#39; shouldn&#39;t medical experts insist that they should be freely distributed to all people everywhere? ... or is their &#39;goodness&#39; derived in part from the profit that compulsory vaccinations will deliver to drug companies? We will only know the answer when the &#39;truth&#39; does not benefit the &#39;truth-sayer&#39;.</p>

<p>As for rights, no-one  has the right either to grant or deny someone else&#39;s right to live. The right to live is fundamentally linked to the right to express yourself honestly and authentically... to express an opinion.

<p>You&#39;d be surprised to know that I agree with a lot of what you&#39;ve said there. I think some of what you said in the middle there is waffle and I think you have little or no idea how the scientific method works, but I agree with you overall.

I think some of what you said in the middle there is waffle and I think you have little or no idea how the scientific method works, but I agree with you overall. I agree there&#39;s no right and wrong or good and evil (except insofar as people have labelled those things), but I think you are expecting &#39;fact&#39; to equate to &#39;absolute truth&#39; and this is a problem for you.</p>

<p>To answer one thing directly: yes vaccinations, which would be considered &#39;good&#39; insofar as we can use that word should be distributed to everybody. Unfortunately, we live in a world where economic good is the highest good in the highest echelons of society. This is no longer necessary in a globalised world with the technological capabilities we have, but there&#39;s another discussion for another day.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve read your yin and yang spiel a few times now and I just struggle to see how that means anything at all (not without more definitions - what is energy, for example?), or what your basis for thinking this is. I struggle to see how this is at all demonstrable, could you give some examples? If it is not demonstrable you should explain why you believe it and why I should too.</p>

<p>Facts take me to many, many meaningful places. Facts also help me to get out of places, whether they be physical places or mental states, that have no meaning too. Sometimes no matter how much you want something to be true, it just isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Of course I could take away someone&#39;s right to live. All I&#39;d have to do is kill them (dead = no rights). Of course, I don&#39;t want to live in a world where people go around killing people, so I will refrain from this. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t believe in rights; no right is unalienable (in a practical sense, that is, paper proclamations do nothing), perhaps with the exception of one&#39;s right to think as they wish, but only because nobody can control thoughts. Hopefully that day never comes.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve no idea how you got to &#39;right to express an opinion&#39; from &#39;right to live&#39;; if there&#39;s meant to be some logical connection there, you haven&#39;t made it.</p>

      <p>Chris,
<br />It has been interesting and challenging debating with you.
<br />As for my &#39;yin yang spiel&#39; ... there is no short and sweet way of explaining it but if interested google &quot;The Ecstasy of Yang&quot; which is a paper I presented last year at a conference.</p>

<p>I take your point about dead=no rights. Perhaps our idea of &#39;rights&#39; is more about our hopes for the type of society we want to live in... so we label them as rights hoping that that will assist in achieving universal agreement... a rare and elusive commodity. </p>

<p>In my opinion, living is not simply &#39;not dead&#39;. Living, as suggested by the ancient Greek saying is to &quot;Know Thyself&quot;. The Greeks referred to the state of knowing yourself as &quot;eu-daemonia&quot; (ie. healthy spirit, later translated to beatitude, the state of blessedness, the pursuit of happiness). To know thyself requires interrogation, internal and external, it requires debate, to challenge and be challenged, to be open to criticism, to acknowledge your flaws and to freely offer your talents. To do these things requires a democratic forum, a forum for debate where everyone&#39;s opinion is heard and encouraged... to discourage opinion is to crush the spirit. Living with a crushed spirit is, in my opinion, not living.</p>

<p>The idea of resonance and how it relates to energy is something I&#39;m finalising in another paper... it addresses the relationship between resonance and reason, particularly how human societies were once based on harmony and resonance until the elevation of the scientific method to its current status ... I have no problem with the scientific method or with reason, which is valid when applied to things that can be tested and when it is acknowledged as only one perspective or approach. Unfortunately it is too often used (together with rhetoric) to construct and establish &#39;truths&#39; around matters of opinion...hence you get the idea of orthodoxy, which literally means &#39;correct opinion&#39;. </p>

<p>I suspect that down deep where it counts it is near impossible - even pointless - to try and disentangle the emotional from the rational.  It&#39;s a blurry business.</p>

<p>What we choose to accept, to take on trust, to find unacceptable, to regard as important ... are any of these devoid of an emotional resonance?  We are not all that mechanical.</p>

<p>Even at the pointiest end of great science - the most rational of mathematical speculations - there is always a leap - a guess - a hunch ... a bit of imagination as Einstein would put it.   And it is that little spark that drives the whole show forward isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>Perhaps we need a Recommended Daily Allowance of irrationality.   No harm in moderation.  But just a sprinkle. </p>

<p>But right now we are being force-fed a diet dripping with unreasonableness, idiocy and irrationality.  Like our clogged arteries, our neurones are pumping industrial sludge about. </p>

<p>See there&#39;s probably a month&#39;s worth of adult dolt dose in your average Andrew Blot column for example.  Perhaps a three month serve in a single issue of the Weekend Orstrayun.  Should we tax it?  Plain packaging?  Or just put clear labels warning of excessive levels of silliness ahead?   Perhaps photos of regular readers and the damage done.  Recommending a book for balance.</p>

<p>Some folks would even think I was being silly.  Imagine that!</p>

      <p>Ah, but one mans saliva is another mans spit, isn&#39;t it so? So how to prove that just my definitions are the ones &#39;scientifically proven&#39;? But yes peer reviewed science should have a higher value than someones mere opinions, but that demands also that this &#39;peer review&#39; is made by his/hers peers, doesn&#39;t it? And allowing for politics and adapting yourself to some popular beliefs is not doing a peer review.</p>

      <p>I am delighted to see Patrick&#39;s article featuring so prominently. </p>

<p>I am not all that interested in the vaccination examples, which receive too much of an airing already (especially here). But on the conclusion, &lt;i&gt; &#39;So next time you hear someone declare they’re entitled to their opinion, ask them why they think that. Chances are, if nothing else, you’ll end up having a more enjoyable conversation that way.&#39;&lt;i/&gt; I wondered how that might work in other areas. </p>

<p>On skepicism about anthropogenic climate change, yes - it works. You can discount the views of the small number of (often) engineers, geologists, pro-free-market entrepreneurs and other frequent commentators like Monckton  using unrefereed material who decry the work of climatologists and don&#39;t believe them. Often the former have no primary data or solid analysis themselves to offer and lack relevant qualifications and expertise.  People who have the qualifications and can show that their work is defensible, gain more respect and have a right to more airtime too. Only a tiny debate on the anthropogenic impact in general remains in climatology itself, between climatologists.  99% in favour of AGW theories.</p>

<p>But how do we treat issues like indigenous knowledge of the environment, important in the areas I work in? I face situations in which indigenous knowledge of farming in Africa (I worked in the Sahel, where thare are somei food shortages) is challenged by western agronomists. The latter tend to say they they understand pest resistance and social fertility much better and the crop varieties thay produce will outperform local varieties used by local farmers. The farmers find engineered varieties less good because they don&#39;t account for labour scheduling in farming, suboptimal field conditions, and so-on.  People like me, with a PhD and years of study in this area, disagree with other people with a PhD and years of study in this area. That&#39;s the debate on the science and on knowledge and expertise. Fine. </p>

<p>But what we do with farmer&#39;s knowledge? They write no papers, do not conduct scientific experiments in a field trial setting, and are not invited to agronomy conferences. But they have managed to feed their families for generations and have huge knowlege of farming. Is it correct, as we do, to assign only post-hoc scientific validity to their work , and to their indigenous experimentation, by publishing and fieldwork, without having open debate in which they can participate (and in which they have no interest in their practical knowledge being heard)? </p>

<p>In a struct interpretation of Patrick&#39;s line, farmers don&#39;t get a seat at the table because they are not credentialled researchers and could not reply in an articulate way as to why their opinions are valid. They can reason by assertion but without hard facts. 
<br />Nonetheless they know more about field conditions than anybody else. How to bring them in? Robert Chambers and others argue via participatory research-action work, but it is not the same thing as treatign all knowledge-holders equally.</p>

<p>I do find it odd that in this debate I trust the locals who I feel have more valid expertise capable of feeding Sahelian communities. This is because I am an expert on their situations and have lived with them. They don&#39;t do trials and work  labs on ag stations (about which I am less skilled). </p>

<p>But with  vaccination I trust the scientists. With climate change, ditto. 
<br />In sum, the things missing from the discussion are a) the politics of knowledge, whcih can throw up these inconsistencies and b) use and interpretation of &#39;practical knowledge&#39; that is not scientific, as in the case above.

For the record, here again is the link to my email to Sir Gus Nossal, which also includes reference to discussion threads on The Conversation website: <a href="http://bit.ly/U3ygHo" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/U3ygHo</a>
<br />Looking at other threads, it appears all longer comments have been curtailed. And just when I’d included links to The Conversation threads pertinent to vaccination in my email to Sir Gus Nossal, which I’m circulating via the internet…   Is this censorship by sabotage?
<br />The Conversation’s “Who We Are” page says: “We aim to be a site you can trust”: <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/who_we_are" rel="nofollow">https://theconversation.edu.au/who_we_are</a>   Well my trust in The Conversation, and in the university and research sector, is rapidly diminishing…  I don’t think The Conversation, (or others in ‘the establishment’) likes mere laypeople challenging the status quo on vaccination.  It’s interesting that most of the threads pertinent to vaccination on The Conversation are closed down very quickly, while most other threads remain open.  See for example ‘Study should dispel HPV vaccine myths’: <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/study-should-dispel-hpv-vaccine-myths-9914" rel="nofollow">https://theconversation.edu.au/study-should-dispel-hpv-vaccine-myths-9914</a>  ‘Measles outbreak calls for vaccination vigilance’: <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/measles-outbreak-calls-for-vaccination-vigilance-10042" rel="nofollow">https://theconversation.edu.au/measles-outbreak-calls-for-vaccination-vigilance-10042</a>  Monday’s medical myth: childhood vaccinations are dangerous: <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/mondays-medical-myth-childhood-vaccinations-are-dangerous-10872" rel="nofollow">https://theconversation.edu.au/mondays-medical-myth-childhood-vaccinations-are-dangerous-10872</a> and the list goes on…
<br />I’m considering my position on this and will be making a formal complaint on this matter.</p>

<p>My perception of The Conversation is that, as a topical website it does not have a responsibility to leave its items open indefinitely for comment.

<p>My perception of The Conversation is that, as a topical website it does not have a responsibility to leave its items open indefinitely for comment. After about 10 days, only a few diehards, locked into their own rigid stances are left and there is no &quot;conversation&quot; going on at all, no fresh ideas, just sniping from entrenched positions from long and tedious posts including URLs (perhaps because the poster does not have the courtesy or the ability to summarize them for other readers). After the first couple of days, most posts are not responses to the article; indeed many show no sign of the writer having read or understood the article, and they are responses to responses and drift way &quot;off topic&quot; into battles that can be found at many other sites and even including paragraph plagiarized from other sites. I admit to having played this game a bit myself, but always with a twinge of guilt and a realization that it&#39;s more for my ego than as a genuine contribution to a conversation in a civil society.</p>

<p>If readers/visitors to The Conversation have not made their point within 10 days or have not discovered the particular thread, that&#39;s their lookout. The Conversation provides a daily e-mail alert that enables readers to respond to articles promptly. I would prefer to see The Conversation close off all discussion after 10 days. People who feel badly done by can always search for a sympathetic academic to launch a new topic and a new debate that will take the conversation on beyond where the original topic left it.</p>

<p>The Conversation has involved subscribers in its design and protocols and will probably continue to do so.</p>

<br />See below my correspondence with Gus Gollings, Technical Director of The Conversation:
<br />From: Elizabeth Hart  Date: Fri, Jan 11, 2013 at 8:45 AM
<br />Gus, re your sarcastic response below...
<br />If you had taken the time to look at the screenshots I sent you, you would have seen the [Read more] facility wasn&#39;t working.  
<br />Using the read &quot;Newest&quot; comment option this morning, the [Read more] facility is still not working, see screenshot attached.
<br />What a coincidence, just as I&#39;m circulating a document to Sir Gus Nossal <a href="http://bit.ly/U3ygHo" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/U3ygHo</a> which includes reference to The Conversation discussion threads pertinent to vaccination which contain my long comments.
<br />According to you, Gus, people who leave long comments are &#39;verbose&#39; and &#39;belabour&#39; and &#39;aggrandise&#39; their points.  It appears that people who challenge the status quo on The Conversation are in a no-win situation.  If they&#39;re not a so-called &#39;expert&#39; on a subject the response is: &quot;No, you&#39;re not entitled to your opinion&quot;: <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/no-youre-not-entitled-to-your-opinion-9978" rel="nofollow">https://theconversation.edu.au/no-youre-not-entitled-to-your-opinion-9978</a>   And if they do go to the trouble of providing an argument to back their opinion, they&#39;re accused of aggrandisement, verbosity, and belabouring points...
<br />There&#39;s something really rotten going on here...
<br />Sincerely
<br />Elizabeth Hart

<br />Dear Elizabeth,
<br />All comments longer 500 character are truncated so people who aggrandise their points in detail and through verbosity cannot visually overwhelm the threads.
<br />In cases where comments are truncated in this way, there should also be a &quot;… [Read more]&quot; link which you can click to reveal the entire belaboured point.
<br />Please let me know you if you require further assistance.
<br />Regards,
<br />Gus

      <p>As someone who regularly writes long, verbose, patience-testing comments here, I really don&#39;t see problem with putting long comments behind a &#39;jump&#39;. It makes comments easier to scan and anyone who wants to read the whole comment can do so. So your letter to Nossal (here: bit.ly/U3ygHo) is perfectly visible for anyone who wants to read it. But you&#39;ve clearly decided that everything is one big conspiracy, and have no qualms about insinuating the TC admins are up to something &#39;rotten,&#39; so I doubt you&#39;ll be satisfied with that. (Also, if you want people like Nossal to listen to you, maybe don&#39;t call people like him &quot;so-called &#39;experts&#39;&quot;. People who have dedicated decades of their life to study and research kind of get offended when people who haven&#39;t done the hard yards insist their views are of equivalent standing. Can&#39;t imagine why). </p>

      <p>On the subject of so-called ‘experts’, people who take it upon themselves to dictate poorly evidenced medical interventions can expect to be challenged.  Experts/professionals in our society hold a privileged position as trusted advisors.  They must be held to account if they abuse their position of trust, e.g. by failing to obtain ‘informed consent’ for medical interventions.  
<br />For example, along with my colleague Bea Mies, I have been campaigning against over-vaccination of companion animals for the past four years (i.e. “done the hard yards…”).  Here’s a link to a brief summary which also includes a list of hyperlinks to some of the correspondence, submissions and articles we have produced on this topic: <a href="http://bit.ly/VcmCLG" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/VcmCLG</a> 
<br />See for example my essay circulated in June 2009 “Over-vaccination of pets – an unethical practice”: <a href="http://bit.ly/11sEt5h" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/11sEt5h</a> and my article “Vaccine failure!” which warns there is a potential for maternally derived antibodies (MDA) to interfere with a puppy’s response to core vaccination, and calls upon the World Small Animal Veterinary Association’s (WSAVA) Vaccination Guidelines Group to provide clear and objective advice on optimal puppy vaccination, and an optional titre test confirmation protocol: <a href="http://bit.ly/lB9YDH" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/lB9YDH</a> 
<br />As a result of our persistent efforts, change is slowly happening in companion animal vaccination practice.  It is a disgrace that members of the public have to be the leaders for change due to the failure of self-interested experts/professionals in the veterinary vaccine industry.  
<br />CHOICE, the consumer watchdog, took up the matter of over-vaccination of pets in August 2010, i.e. “Pet vaccination: Over-vaccinating your pet could be harmful to their health as well as your own hip pocket”: <a href="http://bit.ly/VWuu2h" rel="nofollow">http://bit.ly/VWuu2h</a>  
<br />Over-vaccination of companion animals, and exploitation of pet owners, is big business, worth billions of dollars on an international basis.  My experience in this area is informing my investigation into lucrative over-vaccination of humans, as there are parallels to be considered.  I’m appalled that people such as Patrick Stokes and others are trying to impede progress on this matter.
<br />It is also notable that the university and CSIRO funded The Conversation website is determined to ignore the queries I have raised on discussion threads about: 
<br />-	the second arbitrary ‘booster’ dose of the live measles/mumps/rubella vaccine: <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/measles-outbreak-calls-for-vaccination-vigilance-10042" rel="nofollow">https://theconversation.edu.au/measles-outbreak-calls-for-vaccination-vigilance-10042</a>; 
<br />-	questionable universal vaccination of adolescents with a 3 shot vaccine for the low risk HPV virus: <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/catch-cancer-no-thanks-id-rather-have-a-shot-7568" rel="nofollow">https://theconversation.edu.au/catch-cancer-no-thanks-id-rather-have-a-shot-7568</a>; 
<br />-	questionable whooping cough ‘boosters’ for a new strain of whooping cough, i.e. how does increasing the numbers of ‘boosters’ of the existing vaccine protect against the new strain?: <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/vaccine-resistant-whooping-cough-takes-epidemic-to-new-level-5959" rel="nofollow">https://theconversation.edu.au/vaccine-resistant-whooping-cough-takes-epidemic-to-new-level-5959</a>; and 
<br />-	the ongoing controversy of ‘lethal flu virus’ development, i.e. the US National Institutes of Health is funding research into making H5N1 more transmissible – does this contravene the Biological Weapons Convention?: <a href="https://theconversation.edu.au/censoring-influenza-research-gagging-scientists-could-put-lives-at-risk-4978" rel="nofollow">https://theconversation.edu.au/censoring-influenza-research-gagging-scientists-could-put-lives-at-risk-4978</a> 
<br />There’s a ‘big picture’ on lucrative over-vaccination which it appears many are reluctant to consider.  
<br />The Australian Academy of Science has now taken it upon itself to enter the vaccination fray with its publication “The Science of Immunisation: Questions and Answers”: <a href="http://www.science.org.au/policy/immunisation.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.science.org.au/policy/immunisation.html</a>
<br />The members of the Australian Academy of Science’s Oversight Committee for this publication can look forward to some more questions from me in due course.

I notice you are using your skills as a philosopher to set up such a situation, do you derive pleasure out of setting up bullies who take advantage of the eloquent, but ethically problematic, argument you have presented in this piece to  demean people simply for daring to partake in this conversation. The argument you have developed here does not pass everyone&#39;s muster, and the fact that you&#39;re clearly not taking any responsibility for the sophistry you have developed to empower these bullies is doing harm. I think I am entitled to my opinion, which is that I think it is time for you to write another piece. Remember Socrates - he paid for sticking to the noble truth with his life, you need do much, oh so very much less than that! </p>

      <p>Hi Dania,</p>

<p>Could you point to some of this &quot;barely disguised cyberbullying and mobbing&quot;? Are you referring to the discussion here, or elsewhere? Which comments here seem outside the normal cannons of civil debate to you? (Serious question). </p>

<p>I&#39;ve recently seen quite a few anti-vaxxers who are prepared to condemn whole swathes of people (up to and including the entire medical profession) of whom they know nothing as corrupt, greedy, and immoral, with no credible evidence to that effect, then call anyone who points out how weak their arguments are a &#39;bully&#39; or worse. I find this curious. Apparently impugning the character of tens of thousands of strangers on the basis of stunningly unlikely conspiracy theories is ok, but telling someone that their opinion is not as valid as someone with degrees and professional experience on a topic is abuse. </p>

<p>Just on Socrates, a couple of years ago I was teaching a class on the Apology [for anyone reading this who doesn&#39;t know it, it&#39;s Plato&#39;s account of Socrates&#39; ultimately unsuccessful defence on charges of impeity and corrupting youth], and had a chance to try out an electronic voting system in class. At the start of the class I asked the students to vote on the question &quot;Given the laws in place at the time, were the Athenians right to condemn Socrates to death?&quot; I then got them to vote again on the same question at the end of the lecture. At the end, slightly more students were in favour of execution than at the start! Socrates may be long gone, but his power to annoy people enough to make them want to kill him apparently lives on :)</p>

      <p>Patrick. Thanks for responding so swiftly. This forum is not your class. We are not in the student - lecturer mode. I have absolutely no problem with an article which outlines a method for how a good argument should be constructed. I have no problem either with a discussion on how one needs to provide a system of acceptable evidence to back ones argument with. What I do have a problem with is the incivility which these arguments have prompted toward those who dared to confront the consensus here and elsewhere. There is no reason why one cannot contradict a belief held by someone else, and yet still do so in a respectful manner. 
<br />As one who has pointed out some regular commentators on TC as bullies (which I think you mean in your veiled comments), I have seen how your &#39;rules&#39; of argument empower some, yet disempower others. I know that some of the opinions of medicos and scientists have been challenged here, and I have done this myself. However, I can see that they have been challenged where they tell untruths, or stretch and misreperesent evidence to suit certain ideological perspective. I also see how &#39;evidence&#39; is manufactured, and represented simply on the apparent basis that the &#39;experts know better&#39;.
<br />Above here I see Maryl Dorey being ridiculed and abused by people, who set upon her personally in the manner in which starving vultures descend on a corpse. I happen not to agree with what she stands and argues for. Standing back from it all, so to speak, what stands out for me is that she has been civil and tried her best to explain her position, such as it is. In response, there were few attempts to be civil to her in return. Comments such as, &quot;You are a fringe dweller (even though you clearly don&#39;t see yourself as one). Your opinion on vaccination is as valid as a flat Earther&quot;, &quot;Maybe if you had the tools to properly evaluate reality you wouldn&#39;t be such a crackpot&quot;, etc.. Then followed the paternalistic comments by the &#39;experts&#39; who so much like to put lay people down for holding some opinions. Then there were those demanding some commentators hold qualifications before they could comment, and so on. Lastly, I was prompted over to this thread by the comment which Michael J. I. Brown made on the thread under his recent article: &quot;When it comes to what to believe, I very much agree with <a href="http://theconversation.edu.au/no-youre-not-entitled-to-your-opinion-9978&quot" rel="nofollow">http://theconversation.edu.au/no-youre-not-entitled-to-your-opinion-9978&quot</a>;. Keeping in mind what this chap believes, how is it that he refers to your article here to justify his stance, Patrick?  Apparently he believes that it is mainly those scientists over 50 who are providing the science which &#39;deniers&#39; of his &#39;real&#39; science that are problematic - hence the title of his paper, and the statement:  &quot;As elderly scientists fade from view [i.e., die] and aren’t replaced by credible alternatives, the public debate will stop questioning the science&quot; [that is, his &#39;science&#39;]. You see what your article is justifying, Patrick? 
<br />[Did you also tell your students that the city build a statue to honour Socrates after his death?]

      <p>Ms Ng - you seem to be having a different discussion to the one many others are having on this thread.</p>

<p>The premise of the article is that, if one is to present an opinion and have it seen as valid, it needs to be backed up with evidence,a nd the evidence needs to be credible.</p>

<p>The author has used the example of Australian anti-vaccinationists, with Ms Dorey as (recently resigned) leader (since 1994). Certainly Ms Dorey appears to be reasonable in her tone on this particular thread, but many who comment here are probably aware of her previous comments, accusing the entire medical profession of conspiring with &quot;Big Pharma&quot; to harm children, claiming that no vaccine has ever benefited anyone, and describing vaccination as &quot;rape with full penetration&quot;. These comments are well-documented - there is no need to take my word for it.</p>

<p>In that context, it&#39;s hard to take Ms Dorey;s measured tone seriously.</p>

<p>In the context of vaccination, the discussion and its conclusions can influence the health of children, and the public health of the community. This is more serious than discussing whether Socrates should have been condemned, or whether Lance Armstrong deserves his medals - it&#39;s about the health of children, and the type of public dishonesty that can threaten that.</p>

      <p>Dania  I have spent a very entertaining hours reading this conversation.  I have worked in the field of Autism and early intervention for 15 plus years.  I have seen so much nonsense with no concern for outcome based data or at least rationale inform therapy based on scientific studies, pushed onto parents lacking the training in science to tell the difference.  Often those pushing these therapies etc actively push parents away from proven approaches or at least those that collect data by dissing science or making out some sort of &#39;conspiracy&#39;.  I have seen this has cost people their homes and children their future.  It also implies those of us following science as humbly as we can are actually some sort of profiteers or heartless egoists.  Its pretty nasty stuff at times.    </p>

<p>I won&#39;t get drawn into the MMR debate (partly because I have seen enough kids WITHOUT the MMR come to me with a Dx of ASD) and partly because frankly Ms Dorey refuses to play by the rules she asks of everyone else.  She will not take responsibility for her claims (even though she challenged people to provide evidence of these unscientific and harmful claims and then refused to acknowledge the posters who responded to her exactly as she demanded). Also, she and those seemingly positing in support will not cite references with the level of responsibility Sue Ieraci showed.  (Were you not horrified and offended to find that when she actually investigated the said reference offered as proof it failed at almost all levels to be what the poster claimed?  This is as low as it gets in scientific debate - it is akin to lying. I see this all the time where &#39;thought&#39; pieces are referenced as evidence or its not even about the topic at hand.  Lastly, she plays into conspiracy theories that defy logic to me.  I am a clinical psychologist - I do not trust drug companies that much either.  But do you seriously think people who have committed to going through the often humility generating process os training for the sciences (yes it hurts when you realise how many of your opinions are really just emotion and baggage and you are not as smart as you think you are - nor is the world so black and white as it seemed) are just seeking power and status as Ms Dorey implies?   </p>

<p>Lastly,  there is nothing elitest in pointing out that all opinions are not equal.  Of course they are not.  My dad is an electrician.  I ask him for his thoughts on energy saving lighting for my home and pay scant regard to my neighbour who seems to think he knows everything and is qualified in nothing but a lot of time on Google.  Conversely,  my father listens to me when curious about strategies to promote development in my nephew who has a Dx of ASD.  There is nothing elitest in that.  </p>

<p>Please bear something else in mind.  All the scientists are taught to be critical of each other.  We are trained it is not personal and we really don&#39;t take it as such - even when it hurts.  The idea must stand up to the challenges of the scientific method and judgements given by the data.  That is what I see here in the discussion,  scientists demanding that ideas stand up. I see nothing particularly personal that is not matched by Ms Dorey. Indeed she seems to be using such claims as a way of dodging replying to the astute questions and evidence presented to her. </p>

<p>Lastly - all the people with science training were once laypeople.  None of the laypeople (who indeed may be VERY intelligent - my dad is a genius I suspect) have been scientifically trained.  So could the lay people, instead of taking what looks like an anti intellectual stance at times, perhaps at least acknowledge they are not in the same position to comment on science, its methods and its culture and show some of the humility they claim they are not getting from the &#39;elitests&#39;?</p>

<p>Of course this is purely an opinion...   Discourse is important.  But reason, evidence and data must be the judge in the end. IMHO</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Darin</p>

      <p>Thanks for the thoughtful comment, Darin. Perhaps it may surprise you to hear this, but I don&#39;t actually attack science, I think you&#39;ll see from what I have written that I never do this, and that&#39;s simply because I believe science is an extremely useful method of making sense of our physical world. What I feel quite strongly about is the tendency for some scientists to use scientifically-derived knowledge for political ends, where they manipulate what is to be counted as legitimate knowledge. I have written elsewhere about scientism. I am not at all in favour of not vaccinating children. But I do have a healthy scepticism of Western medicine (pun intended), and I thread cautiously around medicos. This is derived from personal experience, meeting and working with so many incompetent nurses and doctors in the course of my life (though of course I have also met some incredibly talented ones). Prior to here, I don&#39;t recall hearing of Ms Dorey and the organisation she worked with. I simply noted the mobbing aimed at her comments on this thread as an example of the effects of the article on which she commented. I was quite keen to get the author here to address some of the effects of his article, which has spread beyond here. For instance, I mentioned how another author for this publication even referred to it so to justify his approach that implied we ought to cherish the future, when scientists who are over 50 now will all be dead (expressing it as &quot;one funeral at a time&quot;), this apparently to do away with sceptics of the big bang theory, among others. Science at its best? </p>

      <p>Ignorant buffoon. Well done you for making her point for her so clearly.</p>

<p>Dania, a conversation is, at it&#39;s best, a wide-ranging discussion of ideas. Similarly, a degree is meant to provide training in thinking usefully about ideas and situations one has not previously encountered. Sadly, in some cases this admirable intent produces instead narrow-minded, self-important fools, capable only of reiterating pre-digested ideas from &quot;approved&quot; sources. </p>

<p>Sadly, the vast growth in tertiary education has produced far more of that type than the genuinely capable thinkers that is its express purpose. Those buffoons will be our next generation of leaders, when all they have learnt is how to follow.</p>

<p>In my view, it is those people who Patrick Stokes should have directed his piece at, but by offering the dog-whistle of an &quot;unapproved&quot; viewpoint from Dorey, all he did was encourage a pack to form.</p>

      <p>Do you think it might be a good idea to shut these comments down? Whilst a good discussion is always welcome, this has just descended into name calling and totally irrational arguments. Nothing is going to be learnt here, and the usual suspects are doing their thing of attacking everyone who asks them to respond with facts, figures and an intelligent argument. This meat has been out in the sun too long and it&#39;s attracting disgusting things.</p>

<p>I really don&#39;t know why people keep on responding to them. It&#39;s like probing a sore tooth with your tongue. You know what they&#39;re going to say. You know they are going to be personally abusive. You know they are irrational and pointless. Just leave them alone and they can crawl back to the usual forums to complain they have been picked on. I really see little point in this &#39;conversation&#39; continuing.</p>

      <p>Who are these &quot;usual suspects&quot; Vanda? the most recent posters are Sue Ieraci, Dania Ng, Debra Joan Smith and myself. Which of us are you referring to?</p>

<p>I do take exception to your efforts to shut down a conversation you don&#39;t seem to have had any participation in for some months. If you don&#39;t want to read what&#39;s being said, then it&#39;s a simple matter for you to unsubscribe, which I recommend you do.  </p>

<p>However, I also agree with you that the discussion has run its course. It could have been a decent discussion about how we evaluate information and the sources it flows from, but because of Patrick&#39;s use of the Dorey woman as an example, it was swamped by self-righteousness and became a venue for spleen-venting and abuse by people who should know better.</p>

<p>I&#39;m taking my own advice and unsubscribing.</p>

      <p>I haven&#39;t taken part in it Craig, because it was clear which way it was heading. The anti vacc people in here proved the point of this article months ago. It was fun for a while watching them descend even further into gibbering moronhood, but really.....yawn.</p>

<p>And I have now switched off the notifications. Gosh, thanks for the heads up Craig. Silly me would never have thought of that. Of course, initially I thought nothing of having them on because I didn&#39;t think things would go on this long. Guess it must be slow over in anti vacc land.</p>

      <p>I find irony in the fact this article was written by a philosopher with an especial interest in Søren Kierkegaard!  Was it not Kierkegaard who discussed subjectivity? He argued that doubt is an element of faith and that it is impossible to gain any objective certainty about the existence of God - the best one could do would be to believe the probability that religious doctrines are true, but believing such doctrines, only because they seem likely to be true, does not demonstrate genuine religious-ness (faith); faith requires an absolute, subjective, commitment to the entire religious doctrine...</p>

<p>The desire for vaccines to be perfect protection for the masses is much like religious dogma.  One must turn a blind eye to any research which demonstrates a flaw in vaccine perfection, and avert one&#39;s gaze from the list of known neurotoxins, teratogens, mutagens, poisons, aldulterants, and other toxins listed as ingredients in the vaccine concoction;and take, as an article of faith, that, once injected into the human body, these items become &quot;safe.&quot;  One must take, on faith, that the harm to some is acceptable because the many are saved.  </p>

<p>What the dissenting opinion recognizes, is that simply reading SUMMARIES is NOT the same as actually reading (and understanding) the construct of the study, how it was performed, and from what the soundbites were derived...</p>

<p>For example, the Danish study (oft-cited as &quot;proof&quot; thimerosal is not linked to Autism) clearly does not prove this at all - the initial research was performed using only the in-patient population, after removal of mercury, they included the country&#39;s entire populous in counting the numbers with Autism (apples to oranges) even if this were not the case, the Danes used significantly fewer vaccines and they were administered much later in life than occurs in the US...Again, apples and oranges.</p>

<p>Many &quot;truths,&quot; touted by vaccine-supporters are not supported by fact:
<br />For instance, regarding polio, consider the following from <a href="http://christianparty.net/polio.htm" rel="nofollow">http://christianparty.net/polio.htm</a>) -</p>

<p>Dr. Jonas Salk , creator of the polio vaccine, says that analysis indicates that the live virus vaccine in use since the 1960&#39;s is the principle, if not sole cause of all polio cases since 1961. Polio was pretty obscure before the twentieth century. There&#39;d been some outbreaks in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and most victims had been under the age of four. Note that these polio epidemics in earlier centuries ended on their own without the Salk and Sabin Vaccines</p>

<p>Polio: 33,300 total cases of polio and 33 cases of paralytic polio in 1950 led to 9 deaths, but AFTER the Salk Vaccine had been widely implemented in 1960, paralytic polio cases increased 80 fold to 2,525</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus_93.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus_93.pdf</a></p>

<p>Thanks to the Polio vaccine, &quot;98 million Americans were also contaminated with monkey viruses [i.e., SV40 from the Salk and Sabin Vaccines] and may be one reason why there has been an explosion of cancer, new infectious agents and other new immune and neurological disorders among the baby boomers born between 1941 and 1961.&quot;</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, the polio vaccine culture was the origin of HPV; and now we have a vaccine for the disease cause by another vaccine...Par for the course, the HPV vaccine is maiming young women at an alarming rate; literally causing them to drop like flies...Go big pharma!</p>

<p>Where is your PROOF that any of the vaccines actually are effective? Historical charts indicate the sharp decline of each disease supposedly cured by vaccine well prior to the introduction of the vaccine...Here&#39;s a nice summary of history for you: <a href="http://www.whale.to/vaccines/decline1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.whale.to/vaccines/decline1.html</a></p>

<p>And about &quot;herd immunity,&quot; that is a serious farce...Vaccines do not prevent individuals from contracting or carrying the disease they &quot;prevent;&quot; as a matter of fact, by design, individuals MUST regularly be exposed to the virus&#39; to maintain vaccine immunity (much as unvaccinated individuals, exposed to the same circulating virus&#39; develop immunity), otherwise the vaccine immunity wanes; this is why some &quot;fully vaccinated&quot; individuals still contract the full-blown disease and others suffer mild cases. If you read the vaccine literature, vaccine immunity is only temporal and can last up to a number of years; or not. So basically, one must wonder, if both natural- and vaccine-immunity are created and preserved by exposure to the same virus&#39;, and both vaccinated and un-vaccinated individuals run the risk of contracting these virus&#39;, then why not get rid of the medical procedure middle-man and return to nature&#39;s method of immunity (which, once conferred is life-long)? After all, if one DTaP, MMR, Varicella, etc. vaccine doesn&#39;t work the first time, why will a whole series work any better?</p>

<p>If God made us in His image, I would think our bodies were already designed perfectly to cope with whatever Nature had in store...The issue seems to be what Man makes and introduces...In the case of vaccines, up to 32 shots by 24 months of age?! Seriously!!!
<br /><a href="http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/downloads/child/2009/09_0-6yrs_schedule_pr.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/downloads/child/2009/09_0-6yrs_schedule_pr.pdf</a></p>

<p>It is interesting to note that, despite a rash of measles in 2008 (&quot;Sixty-three of the 64 patients were unvaccinated or had unknown or undocumented vaccination status, one patient had documentation of receiving 2 doses of MMR vaccine...One was a child aged 12 months who was exposed in a physician&#39;s office when receiving a routine dose of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine.&quot;) Some were hospitalized, but NONE died.</p>

<p>With regard to the mumps, one-third of the 900 people with the mumps in Iowa were vaccinated, as a matter of fact, CDC officials said that most of the confirmed cases are among 16- to 22-year-olds who&#39;ve gotten two doses of the mumps vaccine...So now, they are considering adding ANOTHER MMR to the schedule...</p>

<p>It is also interesting to learn that those vaccinated against the flu are more frequently hospitalized...Three times more frequently.</p>

<p>Returning to Kierkegaard, &quot;What the age needs is awakening. And therefore someday, not only my writings but my whole life, all the intriguing mystery of the machine will be studied and studied.&quot;  Until vaccines are truly studied, using sound construct, and appropriate control groups, there will be dissenting opinions; and, accordingly, decisions made by individuals using either subjective faith or objective criteria...</p>

      <p>Decent summary of Kierkegaard, Liz. The rest of your points have all been debunked elsewhere I&#39;m afraid, but I&#39;ll leave it to someone with the relevant training to go through that. </p>

<p>One point I can comment on though: &quot;If God made us in His image, I would think our bodies were already designed perfectly to cope with whatever Nature had in store...The issue seems to be what Man makes and introduces...&quot; Obviously that argument only works if one accepts that a) there&#39;s a God who&#39;s b) perfect and c) made us in His image. So it&#39;s not going to have much purchase with those of us who don&#39;t accept a) in the first place! But even if there is a God, it&#39;s straining credulity to say that the human body is perfectly designed for its environment such that every instance of the body failing to cope is down to human intervention. What human intervention is the cause of, say, short-sightedness? The fact that childbirth hurts so much? The fact that knees are so prone to wearing out? To simply assert that these things *must* somehow be down to something humans do &#39;wrong&#39; even though we have no idea what that might be does seem like more like an article of faith than a reasoned belief. </p>

      <p>The knees.</p>

<p>As far as I know, Homo Habilis were using fire first.  Fire was one of many steps that changed human culture and physiology to it&#39;s modern forms.</p>

<p>Modern knees descend from that.</p>

<p>It could also be said that because of fire.....we have reading in poor light, and thus, short-sightedness.</p>

      <p>It&#39;s a bit of a leap to say that fire (and other early human inventions) caused us to evolve weaker legs. Even after we shifted from hunter-gatherer tribes into larger agricultural societies, we used our legs with the same kind of regularity and necessity up until perhaps the last century or so. (A couple of centuries seems hardly enough time to noticeably change human physiology.)</p>

      <p>On the contrary our knees are probably stronger but there hasn&#39;t been enough time for them to get strong enough to counter-act the effects of:</p>

<p>1.  Advancing life expectancy associated with not eating raw meat made possible with fire
<br />2.  Changes in Vitamin D levels contributing to muscular and skeletal strength (reduction) associated with performing more activities at night and moving to colder climates made possible with fire.
<br />3.  Changes in weight distribution associated with changes in food consumption that coincide with changes in standing in a more erect position (more weight on the knees) that was furthered with the use of fire.</p>

<p>We&#39;re seeing more knee problems these days because</p>

<p>1.  Life expectancy is at it&#39;s highest. 
<br />2.  Vitamin D blood serum levels are at it&#39;s lowest
<br />3.  We&#39;re eating more food and exercising less (weakening muscles) but able to stand fully erect, and doing so without transferring that weight outward from the knee through movement, because lifestyles are more sedentary.</p>

<p>All of these are long term consequences of cultural shifts that began with fire. But in evolutionary terms, it&#39;s the short term.  If we survive another million years or so, our knees will change, although our cultures change much faster than that.</p>

      <p>One comment I have on the above article is that we should we should reject arguments from authority. &quot;This guy is an expert and he says X.&quot; Our job in such a discussion is to make sure that the &quot;expert&quot; has also gone through some sort of process, whether it is analysis of hard data or evidence, or logical analysis.  </p>

<p>In the States, during the influenza epidemic of 1918 and following, the Surgeon General advised that sufferers should take Aspirin and go to bed.  The science behind the advice was not understood other than the aspirin lowered temperatures and, by going to bed, sufferers could avoid spreading the disease.  Still, it was the right advice and saved many lives, despite the deaths caused by the high doses of aspirin prescribed at the time.   In that case, the best guess of the &quot;expert&quot; was pretty good.  There was at least something behind his opinion besides a guess.</p>

      <p>At the risk of starting another fire, I could not fail to notice some interesting parallels between this debate and those surrounding another series of articles in The Conversation-  the articles about biomedical research using animals.</p>

<p><a href="http://theconversation.com/the-elusive-ethics-of-animal-ethics-committees-10056" rel="nofollow">http://theconversation.com/the-elusive-ethics-of-animal-ethics-committees-10056</a></p>

<p>I will not, on purpose, go into the more emotional aspects of this debate. However, a key aspect of the argument from those proposing a ban on animal experimentation is the argument that studies using animals are not telling us anything useful- for example, that they do not lead to any cures to human disease, either in the short or long term, and are just wasting time and resources. The justification often involves the idea that anything worth doing can now be done either in vitro or using simulations.</p>

<p>Against this viewpoint, there are  voices from various scientists and people in the health professions (as well as a few people who have benefited from treatments), who support the view that animal-based research is still very much necessary (e.g., you cannot simulate something if you don&#39;t know how it works, etc.), and that a ban would cause a lot of damage down the track.</p>

<p>These debates often evolve towards something similar to what we see here- whether the opinion of a member of the public, however well informed they believe to be, versus the opinion of the specialists. The same questions are often asked (what kind of degree you have, etc.). IN adition, like this debate, the minority position can always refer to the opinion of a few dissenting scientists and scientific papers for support, but the overwhelming majority says otherwise. </p>

<p>Is this also a case where one opinion should not be weighted the same as the other?</p>

I think people avoid that question because they don&#39;t want to get into an argument over whether nonhuman animal lives have intrinsic value, and if so how much - but if we&#39;re going to talk seriously about the ethics of animal research, working out what we think animal lives are worth and weighing that against potential research outcomes seems unavoidable.</p>

<p>Thanks for replying. This is exactly why I decided not to discuss what I referred to as &quot;the more emotional aspects&quot;. The moral argument (&quot;is a given piece of research worth the death and/ or suffering...&quot;) is someting I don&#39;t think we can hope to solve objectively, since the &quot;moral imperative&quot; argument is applied by  both sides of that debate.

      <p>Hi Patrick</p>

<p>Thanks for replying. This is exactly why I decided not to discuss what I referred to as &quot;the more emotional aspects&quot;. The moral argument (&quot;is a given piece of research worth the death and/ or suffering...&quot;) is someting I don&#39;t think we can hope to solve objectively, since the &quot;moral imperative&quot; argument is applied by  both sides of that debate. It will always boil down to a person&#39;s subjective judgement of how many mice are worth the life of a person, and what if this person is a criminal, and what if the person is your daughter, and is a fish or a fly worth the same level of rights as a rat, etc. In any case, it would probably not belong in this thread (as the risk of having it hijacked...). </p>

<p>However, there is something in that debate that, in my view, can be answered objectively, and that has a clear parallel with what we are addressing here: when the Animal Rights groups state, as an integral part of their reasoning, that animal research can be discontinued without damage, should we attribute the same value to their viewpoint, as opposed to the viewpoint of the vast amajority of scientists and health authorities? </p>

<p>I think that this is a critical point. If one takes the Animal Rights viewpiont as truth, then the moral question is obviated, since there will be no damage to human lives incurred by stopping animal research. In other words, no one is likely to suffer or die unnecessarily in the future, from the lack of progress in medical science. On the other hand, if their viewpoint is clearly open to major criticism on objective grounds (e.g. by stopping animal research you are denying people from a chance to be cured, or to recover better from an accident), then the moral argument for stopping animal research has to be restrcutured accordingly.</p>

      <p>Thanks Sandra, very well-stated - and yes I think you&#39;re quite right about that. I&#39;d probably be considerably more optimistic about the prospects for the moral argument, but then I&#39;m a philosopher, I would say that :)</p>

      <p>Good article - however</p>

<p>&quot;&quot; Mediawatch host Jonathan Holmes was considerably more blunt: “there’s evidence, and there’s bulldust,” and it’s no part of a reporter’s job to give bulldust equal time with serious expertise. &quot;&quot;</p>

<p>The plain fact is, many years ago the western media adopted the firm stance of giving equal time to the bulldust.  Insofar that it makes for more lasting controversial news, and importantly - sells better.   Freedom of the press, and all that</p>

        <p>Yes, Patrick. While everyone can have an opinion, if they expect others to listen, they need to provide informed argument. There is a trend toward blurring beliefs or preferences with evidence.

What is this but an expression of feeling, instinctive preference or prejudice?  Talk back radio supplies plentiful evidence of this.  The ABC host, Jon Faine, was actually censured for demanding a speaker provide &quot;evidence&quot; for an opinion. We seem to have lost the filter that once cautioned people against speaking publically on subjects of which they have no knowledge.  It is a dangerous trend which despite all the technological progress, could catapult us back into the dark ages.  Do we really have to listen to an unfounded opinion such as: Barack Obama is not an American citizen? No. As Patrick Stokes argues, not unless you can argue a case based on research, evidence and reason. Or at least we should not be required to listen to it.</p>

      <p>While I understand and agree with the point being made by the author of this article, at the same time there needs to be a balance. The scientific community, though knowledgeable, is still schooled in particular ways of thinking which are dominated by particular approaches to research. Scientific reasoning, and even medicine, are still relatively new principles and have a tendency to become dogmatic and single-minded with regard to people (and this has been particularly prevalent in the history of psychiatric medicine). </p>

<p>Within this particular debate there also has to be room for accepting the value of other ways of knowing and understanding the world. Yes, there has been considerable evidence that disproves that vaccinations are linked to autism. However, that the arguments of the AVN seem to ring true to a large number of people, despite the lack of scientific evidence, cannot simply be dismissed as the ramblings of a few lunatics who aren&#39;t entitled to their opinions. Rather, I would argue, they need to be properly investigated in a broader, and perhaps even, non-scientific context. From where does this distrust of medicine and scientific rationalism originate? What is medical discourse taking away from people&#39;s experiences? Why are people prepared to potentially put their children at risk in order to resist the powerful expectations of the medical community, pharmaceutical companies and government interventionism? </p>

<p>No, not everyone is entitled to their opinion, but it also needs to be recognised that for a long time those who have enjoyed absolute recognition and little outside challenge (the Christian churches, for instance) have often fallen into a laziness of thinking and of self-criticism which means that they all-too-easily dismiss the experiences of others as &#39;lunacy&#39;, &#39;ignorance&#39;, &#39;hysteria&#39;, &#39;deviance&#39;, &#39;exceptions&#39; and which contemporarily are gradually being scientifically transformed into &#39;outliers&#39;, &#39;statistical anomalies&#39;, &#39;small minorities&#39; and so on.</p>

      <p>Wow. this article is an overt propaganda piece.</p>

<p>It starts off well describing how opinions on technical and science-based issues should be backed up by scientific, facts-based argumentation otherwise they&#39;re invalid.</p>

<p>However it then talks about man made global warming skeptics and &#39;anti-vaccination&#39; proponents as being characteristic of the uninformed and scientifically erroneous.</p>

<p>In fact it tends to be completely the opposite.. You will note when it comes to man made global warming the skeptics back up their arguments with scientific facts and logical arguments. There is overwhelming evidence against significant man made global warming yet the Alarmists have provided no evidence to support it. They merely have speculation about hidden heat content in the oceans causing the current 17 year hiatus in temperature rises. ARGO buoys have shown no such hidden heat.
<br />The IPCC computer models are all drastically wrong, massively exaggerating predicted temperature rises 2 to 3 fold above that of reality. They predict positive feedbacks in their models which drives their alarmist apocalyptic warnings.
<br />These positive feedbacks are proven not to exist, or to be counterbalanced by equal or greater negative feedbacks by empirical data.
<br />There is no mid tropospheric hotspot predicted by the models from extra evaporation of water, this flat out disproves their positive feedback theory. ERBE satellites have shown that Outgoing Longwave Radiation goes up with warming not down as their models suggest, also disproving their positive feedback theory.
<br />Low level cloud albedo, cumulonimbic convective subsidence and radiative mass sinking due to increased warm atmospheric layer height from thermal expansion radiates more energy into space as surface temperatures rise.
<br />if you add to this the climate record whereby the Mediaeval Warm Period is proven to have been globally hotter than today with much less CO2, the fact that CO2 rise lags 800 years behind temperature rise in the climate record (Vostok ice cores) showing temperature drives CO2 not the other way round, the fact that it hasn&#39;t warmed in 17 years despite rising CO2, the fact that Antarctica is at record levels and the Arctic has mostly recovered from it&#39;s 2007 minimum, the fact that sea level rise has not increased, that sea temperature has not significantly increased, not at any rate anywhere near enough to account for the warmists&#39; hidden heat theory, you realise all the evidence is against the Alarmists.</p>

<p>If you also take the huge amounts of fraud and outright lying by scientists and the media you realise this is an agenda, it&#39;s all about power and politics and not science.
<br />Mann&#39;s infamous hockeystick where he gave hundreds of times the weighting to one faulty set of pine proxy data as he did to the others thus causing a &#39;hockeystick&#39; shape in order to get rid of the Mediaeval Warm Period that was shown to exist in all the other proxies is the prime example. The removal of colder high altitude stations suddenly from collation of data to create a warming effect, the tampering of data as in Darwin Australia to &#39;fudge&#39; the data upwards, the placement of temperature stations next to hot asphalt urban facilities, the crossing out of an earlier IPCC report conclusion which stated there was no discernible human influence and replacing it with the opposite &#39;there is a discernible human influence&#39; etc shows the depths to which the highly politicised alarmists will sink to because the science doesn&#39;t support their conclusions.</p>

<p>Now, regarding this article by Stokes, it starts off great, then descends into a personal agenda/rant regarding vaccination. Nothing wrong with having an agenda of course, we all have them, but to tie it up with critical thinking analysis and having an informed opinion is both a mistake and deceptive.</p>

<p>And as has been noted by others here (very few unfortunately) not all &#39;bulldust&#39; is wrong. Indeed, Copernicus and others through the years have been proven to be correct, and the reigning authorities at the time (scientific or other) have been proven to be wrong.</p>

<p>Finally, this site proclaims proudly that: &quot;We welcome debate and dissent, but personal attacks (on authors, other users or any individual), abuse and defamatory language will not be tolerated. Nor will we tolerate attempts to deliberately disrupt discussions. We aim to maintain theconversation.com service as an inviting space to focus on intelligent discussions. Be courteous.&quot;</p>

<p>Yet the appalling personal attacks on Ms Meryl Dorey show this statement by this page to be false. </p>

<p>Those of you who have engaged in personal attacks on Ms Dorey should be ashamed of yourselves - but of course you&#39;re not.</p>

<p>There really are only two types of people in this world: those who are part of the solution, and those who are part of the problem. </p>

<p>For those of you who have tried to belittle and denigrate Ms Dorey, you are obviously, and sadly, in the latter camp.</p>

      <p>It&#39;s a rhetorical move to just dismiss people though without refuting them. Remember the chaser, when they accused Lord Monkton of trolling just because he had an opposing view. I think this sort of approach can lead to the suppression of unpopular speech, which is best left out in the open. </p>

      <p>Someone like Monkton can say what he likes. But speech is a public act, and that also means we&#39;re responsible for what we say; and one of those responsibilities is not pretending to have expertise, or even competence, one does not in fact possess. And it also means caring about whether or not what you say is true (Frankfurt&#39;s distinction between &#39;lying&#39; and &#39;bullshitting&#39; is very helpful here - the bullshitter just doesn&#39;t care, or care enough, if what they say is valid). I don&#39;t think we should stop people saying things that aren&#39;t true, though we should call them out on it; but at some point when you continually violate these basic rules of discourse, you start to forfeit - perhaps only temporarily - the right to be taken seriously as an interlocutor. And pretending to expertise you don&#39;t have is surely such a violation.</p>

      <p>What I am saying it that it takes judgement and expertise to perform the &quot;de-legitimising move&quot; from the assessment that the person in question is trolling, bullshitting, or lying. </p>

<p>It must be done with the utmost caution and not for political, regulatory, religious or other reasons of motivation, but only with regard to the truth.</p>

<p>I think that human beings probably can&#39;t live up to this standard. What you will have if you institute these rules of discourse is that you will in effect get a form of political censorship, the dominance of the view of the majority. </p>

      <p>&quot;But speech is a public act, and that also means we&#39;re responsible for what we say; and one of those responsibilities is not pretending to have expertise, or even competence, one does not in fact possess.&quot;
<br />Complete horsehit, and a stunniong admission of cluelessness about what &quot;public speech&quot; and &quot;freedom of speech&quot; mean.</p>

      <p>Welcome to late-stage hyper consumer capitalism, where your information is governed by corporate interests and tabloid media.</p>

<p>Where anti-vaccers, climate skeptics, chemtrail watchers and alien abductees get as much, nay more, time than scientific experts because it brings in the $$$ for media moguls.</p>

<p>Where the public make their decisions about what to buy, what to think and how to vote based on sponsored messages piped directly to them by our oligarchical overlords.</p>

<p>Welcome to the New Australia.</p>

<p>It&#39;s Fair and Balanced.</p>

<p>On a side note, I remember reading this kind of stuff as science fiction when I was a lad. Never thought I&#39;d end up living it.</p>

      <p>I am happy that I was fortunate enough not to have to deal with someone like this (Patrick Stokes) at university... he cannot understand that he does not live up to his own &quot;philosophy&quot;. He makes the statement that Meryl Dorey is not entitled to her opinion and he vaguely references &quot;studies&quot;. What studies? Most of the &quot;independent&quot; studies on vaccines are sponsored by the companies that produce them.</p>

<p>So Patrick, you&#39;re right, you should not be entitled to an opinion, let alone be unleashed on unsuspecting students...</p>

      <p>If we accept that democracy and the privilege of free speech is not only an entitlement but a gift of that democracy, then everyone does have the &#39;equal&#39; right to express an opinion. </p>

<p>The quandary presents in the form of what is informed and what is not and the degree to which the information can be viewed as valid or expert. In the media there&#39;s the problem of who selects those with the valid or expert view? And does this selection process exclude those who have something important to contribute? I suppose, in the case of media views, it is up to the potential contributor to assert their &#39;opinion&#39; or perspective/interpretation in the form of submissions until the &#39;selectors&#39; take note and establish that opinion through publication of it.</p>

<p>Does this process work in the political arena or in academia? In the political arena the evidence would tend to show that it doesn&#39;t. In academia? It is quite a tricky and different arena … in my opinion (and it depends upon one&#39;s experiences, circumstances … and conditions). Sometimes it&#39;s about who you know and not what you know.</p>

      <p>As someone who studied Law, allow me to advise you, before you lawyer does, the High Court transcript will read, &quot;and so, Mr. Cameron, is it true, that you advised the loony plaintiff that &#39;There are no &#39;experts&#39; in a democracy. That&#39;s the whole point you see. I hope this helps.&#39;&quot;
<br />I will reply, &quot;Yes, yes, you Honourness, I did&quot;.
<br />&quot;Why&#39;d ya do it son?&quot;
<br />&quot;Well your honour, she threatened me with violence&quot;!
<br />&quot;You enjoy the slapping around Andy and don&#39;t forget you challenged me. I have yet to hear anything to back up your claim that you can outsmart and outslap me. I want the thread closed down.&quot;
<br />His/Her Honour: &quot;ROFLMAO. Case dismissed&quot;.</p>

      <p>IF you studied law at all, it must have been some time ago and before legislation was introduced to curtail sexism, sexual harassment and homophobic abuse, i.e., hate speech. Hate speech is not free speech. </p>

<p>You remarks (and I have many documented examples) are sexist. I note that you have not called any man here a &quot;bimbo princess&quot;, a &quot;genderist&quot; and a &quot;whore&quot; (quote &quot;you can lead a whore to water but you cannot make one drink&quot;) </p>

      <p>&quot;Every year, I try to do at least two things with my students at least once. First, I make a point of addressing them as “philosophers” – a bit cheesy, but hopefully it encourages active learning.&quot;
<br />What academic training have these students undergone so far? Their acheievements? Abilities? First year BA student at Deakin? Average ATAR probably about 60.0 What a complete waste of time.</p>

      <p>+this article seems to be implying that yoiu have no right to disagree with a scientist, because the person disagreeing with the scientist has not got a degree in that subject.but  you can be self taught in any subject that you are very interested in.  why are the religious allowed to say any implausible thing they like? mad religious views ruin lots of lives, but society acts as if they are true.
<br /> for instance, why can&#39;t people have scientific views you disagree with? scientists are often wrong and frequently change their views anyway.i could write a long list of them but cant be bothered as i&#39;d be here a long time....! it sounds like you are excusing your desire to bully others into believing what you would like them to believe....you would be better to develop plausible reasons for your beliefs and put them on the internet ,etc, do not do it face to face will get bored and agree  just to stop you earbashing them,,, as people</p>

      <p>We don&#39;t say anywhere that you have no right to disagree with someone who is more qualified.</p>

<p>What we do say is that if you want to present your opinion as fact, then you have to be prepared to defend your opinion with evidence.</p>

<p>This is particularly true when you want to put forward an opinion that is at odds with the vast majority of qualified experts in the field in question. If you want to make a claim that is contrary to the accepted theorum of the day, then you must present exceptional evidence that fits at least these two criteria:</p>

<p>- It must be predicted by your contrary opinion
<br />- It must contradict the accepted opinion</p>

<p>If you are able to do so, then you have my attention.</p>

      <p> In principle I agree...but I have some very serious issues with this article. </p>

<p>First, it essentially makes a fallacy the basis of admission to public discourse. Argument by authority, according to him, should be the way we determine who gets into the media megaphone. </p>

<p>Second, the expert authorities are often either wrong or dishonest or both. The expert authorities said American Atomics was releasing safe amounts of tritium into the air. My mom had her own authority who said otherwise, my grandfather the former head of the Manhattan Project medical team, but to the media she was just a parent with not even a Bachelors degree. By this professor&#39;s reasoning she should have been ignored. In fact she was right and the site was eventually seized by the National Guard, $300,000 of radiated food from the school lunch factory down the block was buried...</p>

<p>The idea that we can safely rely on the argument by authority fallacy to settle our policy debates is dangerous and absurd.</p>

      <p>i can&#39;t believe anyone normal would want to ignore all the times science has been wrong!  the modern media is often the cause of this type of hunting down those who dare to consider another view... we need science, but not fanatical science. they seem to be taking the attitude that they are the only people allowed a view. the internet has brought knowledge to everyone, and anyone can formulate their own view, which may sometimes be as misguided as some scientists can be...</p>

      <p>It&#39;s always interesting to see how opinions are created. To see how often are they are installed on universities (and later throughout society) through lobbyism from big companies who promotes research along certain very shortsighted and purely economical lines; biased to say the least. This process is all too common. As a journalist BA I did research for an article some years ago on possible damages from vaccinations (which I understand are mandatory in USA. The level of Liberty is higher here in Danmark, where I live ;-) ). Some of the statistics on the effect of vaccination were clearly twisted, but since there was big money and votes for politicians involved criticism were underplayed by spin of various kinds.</p>

<p>An example: many of the doctors were reluctant to report damages where vaccination was suspected by the children&#39;s parents - which might explain why the numbers on adverse effects are low in the statistics (by the way, quite a few of the vaccines contained Mercury).</p>

<p>There&#39;s also some research that point to longtime negative effects of vaccinating children, such as arthritis, cancer, asthma, diabetes and cardiac disorders in adulthood.</p>

<p>One of the doctors in the field whom I interviewed commented on the way the Danish State implements children&#39;s vaccination despite certain contradictory indications of the effects (not to mention the whole voluntary aspect): &quot;Spanking!&quot; was her short comment.</p>

<p>The whole story was back then quite a showcase for me on how the pharmaceutical industry works, especially on creating strong and streamlined opinions in both the general public and inside governmental institutions (that of course also goes for teachers in many public educational institutions). I guess most of us know, that a lot of grey-zone stuff is going on in such areas, but it can be a bit heartbreaking to see employees at universities advocate rather carelessly for biased big company research on health issues.</p>

<p>And if you yourself lean towards an opinion, that when parents or the press criticizes the Parnassus on these backgrounds, that &quot;they are not entitled to their opinion&quot; - you could yourself also see a doctor to have a similar mental vaccination - if you have not already done so. Cause many people have - and things become a lot easier afterwards. You get an infusion with a potent valid opinion - and thus do not have to think for yourself anymore. Very smart - and cheap.</p>

<p>I for my part will definitely refuse such mental vaccinations - with the professors permission, of course. Thank you ;-)</p>
