How Medium Is Building a New Kind of Company with No Managers

   [2]Tweet[3]Share[4]Post[5]Save

   Editor's Note: Medium has since changed the way it runs the
   organization as it's scaled. You can read about how they're approaching
   management now [6]here.

   After [7]Ev Williams first started working on Twitter, he reached out
   to [8]Jason Stirman in Texas. "You have to come out here," Williams
   said. "Twitter is happening and we want you to join us." But Stirman
   wasn't easily convinced. "I told him, `You want me to move for 140
   characters and a button? I don't think so,'" Stirman says. "And I'll
   never forget this. Ev looked me right in the eye and said, `If we do
   this right, it'll totally change the way the world communicates.' I
   thought to myself, `I like you, but you're crazy.'" He regretted his
   decision almost immediately, and 18 months later, when Twitter hit 50
   or so employees, he made the jump.

   The next time Stirman had the chance to follow Williams, he didn't
   hesitate. After working at Twitter for several years, he realized the
   founding team was gone, retreating to their lair at [9]Obvious
   Corporation to plot their next big breakthrough. He wanted in. "I quit
   my job, went to them and said, `Ok guys, what are we doing?' Ev looked
   at me and said, `I don't know. Want to rebuild the Internet?'" Stirman
   didn't know what he meant at the time, but it sounded big. It sounded
   right. The result was [10]Medium, a content platform promising to
   change the way people communicate -- again.

   But Medium isn't just taking a revolutionary approach to digital
   publishing -- it's changing the way companies operate too. As one of
   the fiercest and most faithful adopters of[11] Holacracy - a radical
   new theory of corporate structure -- Medium is experimenting with a
   completely management-free environment that's laser focused on getting
   things done. Stirman couldn't be more thrilled with the results: the
   freedom, the momentum, the productivity are all unparalleled, he says.
   But companies don't have to go all-in on Holacracy to reap the
   benefits. If his transition from Twitter to Medium taught him anything,
   there are always more tactics to try to make things work better. Below,
   he shares his lessons from taking the leap.

     Traditional management just didn't agree with me.

   For two years, Stirman managed a team at Twitter and never felt quite
   right about it. There was always the tension between being their boss
   and being their peer. He read all the `right' books on management and
   took the advice to heart: don't get too chummy, shield your team from
   anything they don'tneed to know, ask them to identify roadblocks to
   progress, reward them all equally. He hated it.

   "Management perspective looks at reports as resources -- like how can
   you get the maximum value out of this person," Stirman says. "But when
   I think resources, I think like natural gas or coal mines. Thinking
   about a person's life that way just seemed really dehumanizing."

   Frustrated with poor results, he decided to go off script. He started
   spending one-on-one meetings talking to his reports about their lives,
   instead of their tasks, and productivity shot through the roof. "When
   you sit across a table from someone, ask them `What's going on in your
   life?' That will always remove more hurdles than asking them `What's
   blocking you at work?'" he said.

     Whenever problems popped up, I'd totally ignore them and pay
     attention to the people who had them. Suddenly all these issues were
     just dissolving. I swear it was like a Jedi mind trick.

   He started taking his reports out to lunch, to drinks, to coffee to see
   what was up. How was their wife settling into her new job? Did escrow
   close on their new house? This is the stuff that people bring into work
   with them but never talk about, Stirman says. As soon as you ask, the
   pressure starts to dissipate.

   This more human approach starting paying off in other, less expected
   ways too. "I'd hear that someone on my team had a problem with someone
   on another team that brought everything to a standstill - just because
   they didn't like each other. I thought, what if I just got them in a
   room together and we all talked about everything except the problem at
   hand? When we did, we got some casual conversation going, they
   discovered some similarities, and by the end of the hour they were
   talking about how to solve their issues. This was a conflict that
   literally kept me up at night, and as soon as there was space for them
   to connect as people, it was fixed. I thought, holy crap, this is a
   super power."

   Stirman hit another wall trying to shield his team from external drama
   and politics. "Classic management advice, and all my mentors told me
   that insulating your team from things so they won't worry will make
   them more productive and happier," he says. "But they just got angry,
   and confused, and disconnected. I was constantly censoring all this
   information and they were way happier when they knew everything."

   With these discoveries under his belt, Stirman wanted to test other
   theories of management. "No one ever challenged that there was a better
   way to do things, everything is so tied to who reports to whom," he
   says. "But I'm too much of an engineer at heart. I started looking at
   management like a big A/B test, with a goal of making more data and
   results-driven decisions." In his pursuit of new experiments to run, he
   stumbled on the book "[12]Your Brain at Work," which espouses what's
   come to be known as the SCARF approach.

   SCARF stands for status, certainty, autonomy, relatedness, and
   fairness. "Basically, when a person is honest with themselves, they're
   most motivated by one of those qualities," Stirman explains. "As a
   manager, you can figure out which one motivates which employee, and
   reward them accordingly. A lot of managers will look at their team and
   think, `We should do a round of compensation increases because
   everyone's been working so hard,' but this isn't the best incentive for
   everyone." Here's how it looks:
     * Status-oriented employees can be motivated by a possible title
       change, or having their name attached to more important projects.
     * Certainty-oriented employees are motivated simply by the
       reassurance that their job is important and they are excelling.
     * Autonomy-oriented employees may need the ability to work from home,
       or simply slip on their head phones to tune everyone else out.
     * Relatedness-oriented employees are energized by opportunities to
       socialize with their coworkers -- happy hours, softball games, etc.
     * Fairness-oriented employees want to know the playing field is even,
       and they aren't being exploited or cheated. They need to hear it
       consistently.

   "It turns out that some people really care about one and don't really
   care about the others," says Stirman. "Once I had my team stack rank
   their priorities, I knew exactly how to reach them. All the little
   problems and personality clashes started to fade."
   [javascript] [Vd3O31qzTFyV34D60QlI_Stirman-2.jpg]

   This willingness to break ranks with corporate wisdom set the stage for
   Stirman's arrival at Medium, where clear communication, incentives, and
   accountability are the invisible wires keeping the organization sailing
   along.

Holacracy from Scratch

   Medium adopted the Holacracy model about a year ago. Calling it "hands
   down, by far the best way I know or have ever seen to structure and run
   a company," Stirman says. He's especially drawn to the strategy's
   crystal clear minimalism and logic. "It's basically an operating system
   for your organization, so the engineer in me loves it. In fact the
   Holacracy organization just [13]released 4.0 of its constitution, so
   our company is upgrading -- just like you would update to a new iOS."

Here are some of the key tenets that Medium embraces:

     * No people managers. Maximum autonomy.
     * Organic expansion. When a job gets too big, hire another person.
     * Tension resolution. Identify issues people are facing, write them
       down, and resolve them systematically.
     * Make everything explicit -- from vacation policies to decision
       makers in each area.
     * Distribute decision-making power and discourage consensus seeking.
     * Eliminate all the extraneous factors that worry people so they can
       focus on work.

   "The structure is totally built around the work the company needs to
   achieve its purpose," Stirman explains. "We don't have a hierarchy of
   people, we have a hierarchy of circles." For examples, the Reading and
   Discovery (or RAD) circle, containing roles dedicated to the site's
   reading experience, is nested inside the Product Development circle, as
   is the Creation and Feedback circle, which is all about the content
   creation process. In this instance, the Product Development circle can
   review the results coming out of the nested circles to steer the
   product in a particular direction. Every member of a circle has a
   purpose that connects to the broader circle's purpose, which connects
   to the company's purpose, so everyone is always pulling toward the same
   promised land.

   "At Twitter, the purpose changed a few times, from building a cool
   product to making it popular to making it a sustainable business, and
   changing the world somewhere in there too," Stirman says. "I ended up
   feeling like my job was very disconnected from the higher-level
   purpose, and I know others on my team felt the same way -- it was hard
   to connect the dots."

   To help with this, instead of a focus on employees, there's a focus on
   roles. Each circle has a `Lead Link' who determines what roles the
   circle needs and how they get assigned. In fact, one person can hold
   multiple roles if their bandwidth and expertise allows. Stirman is both
   the People Operations lead and Word Master (which comes with final say
   on punctuation and capitalization, among other word-based dilemmas).
   This way, people can build versatile roles for themselves that speak to
   their whole skill sets -- not just a single ability.

   This role-centric organization also optimizes for number of ideas and
   strategies tried, while also keeping a tight grip on what gets shipped
   live. For example, there's a single role titled 'Product Strategy',
   currently filled by Ev Williams himself, which decides which features
   go public. But, teams like RAD get to decide which ideas actually get
   prototyped and built.

   Once there's too much work for a particular role, it can evolve into a
   circle with multiple members to shoulder the load. "In a traditional
   company, the structure doesn't change based on the work," Stirman says.
   "You see a lot of companies trying to force the work they have into
   their existing structure, and that can get messy."

   This emphasis on organic growth has a side benefit of distributing
   authority. In Holacratic systems, individuals operate without managers
   because many of them have decision-making power in a particular area.
   And since everything is made as explicitly as possible, everyone in the
   organization knows who has authority over what. "It's much better to
   have power distributed as widely as possible so more people can make
   more decisions to move forward," Stirman explains. "This structure
   leads more toward moving fast, trying new things, and adjusting as
   needed. You don't have to wait for everyone up a ladder to sign off.
   This can take weeks or months, when Holacracy says, `You know what,
   we're going to hire the best people we know and trust them to make
   decisions for us.' All day people make decisions, own parts of the
   company, and act on them. The momentum this creates far outweighs
   someone making a bad decision. You also have the momentum to change
   course quickly."

   Decision-making is further aided and hastened by airing `tensions' in
   meetings. Stirman defines this use of tension broadly, calling it "any
   difference between what is and what could be." In this sense, tensions
   can be negative (e.g. I don't have time for that project, my chair
   isn't ergonomic, etc.) or positive (e.g. I have a vision for a feature
   we should create). Tensions are resolved in tactical meetings where
   every attendee either shares a tension or passes. This way, everyone is
   encouraged to speak up if they have a problem or see an opportunity.

   "The difference between Holacracy and traditional management is that
   when you have people at the bottom and people at the top, it's always
   the people at the top trying to figure out their tensions, then they
   have the people at the bottom resolve them," Stirman says. "No one
   takes into account the tensions, ideas, issues felt by the people at
   the bottom. They spend their days resolving tensions they don't have
   and may not even understand."

   In tactical meetings, a trained facilitator builds a list of tensions
   that people throw out to the group, and the remaining time is used to
   resolve them as much as possible. This doesn't mean solving major
   problems. It's about identifying the next right step to a solution. "If
   I'm a guy who says a button should be green instead of red, in a
   typical meeting, that conversation could go on for hours, days, weeks
   without clear action," Stirman says. "A small workable solution would
   be for me to schedule a meeting with our visual designer."

   For Stirman, even before he heard of Holacracy, tensions were always
   easy to identify, but not easy to solve. "Once you identify what a
   tension is, you can feel it in your shoulders, in your ears. You know
   you're worried about something. Now, when I identify a tension, I jot
   it down. If I can't resolve it by myself, I bring it to my circle's
   next tactical meeting. With these meetings, you're always making things
   a little bit better."

How to Think Holacratic

   There's a lot to like about Holacracy when you compare it to classic
   management frameworks, Stirman argues. He has firsthand experience.
   "When I think about my role at Twitter as a manager, I had tensions all
   the time. And my team didn't even have that many problems," he says.
   "Still, between all the teams he oversaw, my manager was constantly
   putting out fires. No one had the time or interest to resolve my
   tensions. Now, the way we use Holacracy, people are genuinely happier,
   they feel listened to, and connected with the organization."

   For companies looking to reap these benefits by injecting the spirit of
   Holacracy into their existing format, Stirman has a few key
   suggestions:

   His focus on hearing people out about their personal lives and problems
   at Twitter is a prime example. It closely resembles a safe space to air
   tensions. In fact, he wishes he would have formalized his more
   personal, human approach so that people would have known they could
   share freely instead of carrying their issues around.

   Holacracy encourages people to work out their tensions and issues
   one-on-one or outside of meetings if possible. Given the rampant
   explosion of meetings in corporate environments (so much so that there
   are meetings about having too many meetings), this is an increasingly
   important tip. Tension meetings are defined as opportunities to air
   issues that couldn't be resolved elsewhere. People should only address
   the group with topics that actually need others to weigh in or help
   find a path forward.

   Establishing mutual accountability can make a highly tiered workplace
   feel flatter, and more engaging. In addition to informing his reports
   about what was going on throughout the company, Stirman wishes he would
   have shared his own list of tasks and concerns with the people on his
   team. That way he would have been accountable to them too and made them
   feel less managed. "At Twitter, there was this common power dynamic
   where my reports felt accountable to me to get their work done and I
   felt accountable to the guy above me. It would have been good to be
   more forthcoming."

   Most of the time, you know your manager's responsible for firing you
   and how much you get paid. I wish I would have sat down with my reports
   and said, "You know what, here's what being a manager at Twitter
   actually means, and here's a list of the decisions I have the authority
   to make. I wish I would have broken that power dynamic, and been a
   better leader as a result."

   Hand in hand with this, it's a great idea to run some of your own
   problems by your reports to see if they can weigh in. "At Twitter, I
   was constantly burdened by my team's problems, and I think most
   managers are," Stirman says. "I wish I had empowered my team to solve
   their own problems, and mine. I wish I would've asked them more
   questions, been more creative about surfacing problems for them to
   solve to make our work better. I found myself scared to tell my reports
   `I don't know' whenever they asked me something, and in hindsight, I
   had this awesome team of smart, capable people who were energized by
   solving problems. Turns out individual contributors love to be asked
   for help. A lot of them want to take that buzzer beating shot. They
   want to be the last guy up at the plate. It gives them a chance to be a
   hero and to flex their muscles. And in the end, it builds more trust in
   me as a leader because I'm not filtering out questions I can't answer."

Hiring in Holacracy

   Given the decision-making power of the average employee in Holacracy,
   you'd think the interview process would be fairly unique, or at least
   intense. But Stirman says it doesn't have to be that much different
   than average -- making it possible for more typical companies to hire
   in Holacratic fashion.

   "When you interview someone, it's pretty easy to tease out if they take
   the initiative to solve problems or take on projects -- or if they're
   simply better at being told what to do. Both are great kinds of people,
   but I've found most fall into one category or the other," says Stirman.
   "I generally ask, `Tell me about a project you're really excited
   about.' The self-starters will talk about a problem they found and how
   they solved it. The people who aren't will say, `My manager came to me
   and said can you build...?' Right away you can tell. And for our kind
   of organization, having to be told what to do just isn't a great fit."

   Don't underestimate culture fit in hiring. This is something Stirman
   can't emphasize enough, especially if you're looking to adopt a more
   Holacratic mindset. "You want to make sure you hire only people you
   wouldn't mind getting stuck in an airport with," he says. "So many
   people fall into this trap of hiring highly skilled people who are bad
   culture fits. And I'd argue that's the worst kind of hire -- even worse
   than a poorly skilled person. If they're as skilled as you think they
   are, they'll gain power, influence and get more deeply enrooted in your
   technology, process and product. Then, when the honeymoon of your
   justifications is over and reality sets in, you're seriously stuck with
   this person."

The Missing Piece?

   "In theory, Holacratic systems should scale much better than
   traditional organizations because circles can expand and divide
   infinitely based solely on the work that needs to get done," Stirman
   says, acknowledging that this is indeed, just a theory, as Medium is
   only at 40 people right now.

   In fact, the Medium team has already discovered something missing from
   the system: praise and feedback. "Managers are usually responsible for
   giving people feedback, directing them, telling them good jobs, and all
   of these things are super important to a healthy environment. You need
   someone to call you out or validate you when you've worked hard,"
   Stirman says.

   Even so, the founding team at Medium decided to take a Holacratic
   approach to the problem. "We created a few roles responsible for giving
   people regular feedback," he explained. "This is where we're starting
   to skirt the lines of having people managers, because it certainly
   sounds managerial, but these roles aren't responsible for people's
   work. It's more of a mentor relationship than a managerial
   relationship."

   These roles are called `Domain Leads' and are filled by experienced
   members of various circles like design and engineering. In addition to
   mentoring, they're also largely responsible for hiring and firing. They
   work closely with the `Lead Links' who define and fill roles in their
   circles to assess performance. "Domain leads are responsible for the
   people, not the work," Stirman says. "It's something we're trying out."

   To supplement this tactic on the positive end, the company also
   introduced a `High Five Machine' -- a dashboard where anyone can write
   in and praise a co-worker, streaming throughout the office. It's an
   invention borne out of Holacracy, spun out of the unique needs this
   kind of system creates.

   "We've already learned a lot, and I'm so glad we're experimenting,"
   Stirman says. "No one knows the future, but now when I hear about the
   way things should be done, or someone saying `here's how it's always
   been done,' or any Management 101, I'm like `screw that.' We may be
   doing things differently just to be different sometimes, but it's also
   allowed us to embrace so many new things."
